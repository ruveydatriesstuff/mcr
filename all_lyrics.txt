if all my enemies threw a party
would you light the candles
would you drink the wine
while watching television
watch the animals and all the tragedies
and sell your arteries and buy my casket gown

it better be black
it better be tight
it better be just my size
i'm stalking these metro malls
and airport halls
and all these schoolgirls say

i'm not asking 
you're not telling
he's not dead he only looks that

way out nowhere take me out there
far away and save me from my
self destruction hopeless for ya
sing a song for california

i buy my enemies rope to hang me
and the knives to gang me
you can watch them stab me
on your television
stalk the halls
because the bathroom walls
would have a lot to say
about the lines you're putting down

it better be white
it better be cut
it better be just my size
until my capillaries 
burst from boredom
i'll be waiting 

i'm not laughing
you're not joking
i'm not dead i only dress that

way out nowhere take me out there
far away and save me from my
self destruction hopeless for ya
sing a song for california

wherever you are 
wherever you are 
whoever you are 
whoever you are

la la la la

'cause we got the bomb we got the bomb lets go
we got the bomb we got the bomb lets go
we got the bomb we got the bomb lets go
we got the bomb we got the bomb lets go

way out nowhere take me out there
far away and save me from my
self destruction hopeless for ya
say a prayer for california

we got the bomb
we got the bomb
we got the bomb
we got the bomb

fell in love with a vampire
you want to get it for free
say hello to the brush fire
you want to take it from me
i'm gonna take it from you

say hello to the good times
burning up in the sun
you're sitting back on an empire
while the world lays back
puts a kid behind that gun

if we crash this time
they got machines to keep us alive
when the mixtape lies
choke down the words with no meaning
i stopped bleeding 3 years ago
while you keep screaming for revolution
me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
we got no heroes cuz our heroes are dead

say hello to the program
they're gonna give it for free
hook up the vein to the antibodies
and cut it with the disease
i'm gonna give it to you

put on your smile for the good times
you're loaded up with the fame
you're dressing up like a virus
but the words get lost when we all look the same

if we crash this time
they got machines to keep us alive
when the mixtape lies
choke down the words with no meaning
i stopped bleeding 3 years ago
while you keep screaming for revolution
me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
we got no heroes cuz our heroes are dead

you fell in love with a vampire
a torch-song for the empire
so say hello to the brush-fire
the microphones got a tap-wire

if we crash this time
they got machines to keep us alive
while the army wives
choke down a war with no meaning
i stopped bleeding 3 years ago
while you keep screaming for revolution
because rebellions not a t-shirt you sell
you keep your money and i'll see you in hell

you don’t know a thing about this life
and we are up for everything it takes to prove we’re not the same as them
and we will wear our masks again out after dark
‘cause we are up for everything it takes and we are not the same

‘cause we are not afraid
and we are not ashamed

and if you save my life
i’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
and if i ever let you down
i’ll be the one who drives you home tonight

remember once you walked this kind of life
quietly i’ll sleep behind the wheel and passing every face you see the first time
singing every piece as you walk by 
proving that with all of my mistakes that we are not the same

‘cause we are not the same
and we are all to blame

and if you save my life
i’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
and if they ever let you down
i’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
you home tonight

it's dropping you down
it's dropping you down
it's dropping you down
it's dropping you down
it's dropping you down
'cause it's dropping you down
and it's dropping you
dropping you down

you don’t know a thing about this life
and you don’t know a thing about this life
and you don’t know a thing about this life
‘cause you don’t know a thing about me
you don’t know a thing

and if you save my life
i’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
if they ever let you down
i’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
you home tonight
drives you home tonight

'cause it's dropping you down
'cause it's dropping you down
'cause it's dropping you down
'cause it's dropping you
dropping you
dropping you down

these are the eyes and the lies of the taken
these are their hearts but their hearts don’t beat like ours
they burn ‘cause they are all afraid
for every one of us there’s an army of them
but you’ll never fight alone
‘cause i wanted you to know

that the world is ugly
but you’re beautiful to me
well are you thinking of me now (now)

these are the nights and the lights that we fade in
these are the words but the words aren’t coming out
they burn ‘cause they are hard to say
for every failing sun there’s a morning after
though i’m empty when you go
i just wanted you to know

that the world is ugly
but you’re beautiful to me
are you thinking of me
like i’m thinking of you
i would say i’m sorry though
though i really need to go
i just wanted you to know

i wanted you to know
i wanted you to know
i’m thinking of you every night every day

these are the eyes and the lies of the taken
these are their hearts but their hearts don’t beat like ours
they burn ‘cause they are all afraid
when mine beats twice as hard

‘cause the world is ugly
but you’re beautiful to me
are you thinking of me
like i’m thinking of you
i would say i’m sorry though
though i really need to go
i just wanted you to know
that the world is ugly (i just wanted you to know)
but you’re beautiful to me (i just wanted you to know)
are you thinking of me

stop your crying helpless feeling
dry your eyes and start believing
there’s one thing they’ll never take from you

(and we’ll never be the same
like ghosts in the snow
like ghosts in the sun)

so long to all of my friends 
everyone of them met tragic ends 
with every passing day
i’d be lying if i didn’t say 
that i miss them all tonight

and if they only knew 
what i would say 
if i could be with you tonight
i would sing you to sleep 
never let them take the light behind your eyes
one day i’ll lose this fight
as we fade in the dark
just remember you will always burn as bright

be strong and hold my hand
time becomes for us you’ll understand 
we’ll say goodbye today 
and we’re sorry how it ends this way
if you promise not to cry 
then i'll tell you just what i would say 

if i could be with you tonight 
i would sing you to sleep 
never let them take the light behind your eyes 
i’ll fail and lose this fight 
never fade in the dark  
just remember that you will always burn as bright

the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your 

sometimes we must grow stronger 
and you can’t be stronger in the dark 
when i’m here no longer 
you must be stronger and 

if i could be with you tonight 
i would sing you to sleep 
never let them take the light behind your eyes 
i failed and lost this fight 
never fade in the dark 
just remember you will always burn as bright 

the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…

the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…

covered and all my friends 
i still think of the bombs they built

if there's a place that i could be
then i'd be another memory
can i be the only hope for you
because you're the only hope for me
and if we can't find where we belong
we'll have to make it on our own
face all the pain and take it on
because the only hope for me 
is you alone

how it should be
many years after the disasters that we've seen
what have we learned
other than people burn in purifying flame
i say it's okay
i know you can tell
and though you can see me smile
i still think of the guns they sell

if there's a place that i could be
then i'd be another memory
can i be the only hope for you
because you're the only hope for me
and if we can't find where we belong
we'll have to make it on our own
face all the pain and take it on
because the only hope for me 
is you alone

the only hope for me
the only hope for me
is you the only hope for me 
is you the only hope

if there's a place that i could be
then i'd be another memory
can i be the only hope for you
because you're the only hope for me
and if we can't find where we belong
we'll have to make it on our own
face all the pain and take it on
because the only hope for me is you alone
the only hope for me is you alone

the only hope for me is you  (remember me remember me)

so hold on tight and don't look back

or the rules they make
i'll find you when the sun goes black

and you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that 
now we are the kids from yesterday

all the cameras watch the accidents and stars you hate
they only care if you can bleed
does the television make you feel the pills you ate
or every person that you need to be

'cause you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that 
now we are the kids from yesterday

today today
we are the kids from yesterday
today today

here we are and we don't stop breathing
yell it out 'til your heart stops beating
we are the kids from yesterday

when we were young we used to say
that 
now we are the kids from yesterday
we are the kids from yesterday
we are the kids from yesterday
we are the kids from yesterday
today today

alright children 
the lights are out and the party's over
it's time for me: doctor d
to start running and say goodbye for a little while
and i know you're gonna miss me
so i'll leave you with this
you know that big ball of radiation we call the sun
well it'll burst you into flames
if you stay in one place too long
that is if the static don't get you first
so remember even if you're dusted
you may be gone
but out here in the desert
your shadow lives on without you
this is dr death defying

there there there
oh i'm such an idiot
our music is way too loud
here let me turn it down a little bit
sorry)

give up and give it a shot
dedication to the places that you never need to hide
occupations the opportunity to see yourself in lights

and all the city fires and the tabloid lies
and the television guides
for the missions and the boulevards
and the way it is when money’s all you got
 
stop and stare
at the accidents and stars that bore you
we don’t dare singing another song for california
anywhere
where the city lights are hopeless for you
we don’t care i needed another song for california
 
shut up and give me a shot
on vacation to the places that you never want to die
on the station everybody hears but no one needs to try

on the telephone on the methadone
every minute that you scrape
for the errant scars and the dying stars
every second that you take to fake your life
 
stop and stare
at the accidents and stars that bore you
we don’t dare singing another song for california
anywhere
where the city lights are hopeless for you
we don’t care i needed another song for california
 
stop and stare
at the accidents and stars that bore you
we don’t dare singing another song for california
anywhere
where the city lights are hopeless for you
we don’t care i needed another song for california

i don't like being alone
burn up these streets
turn up the stereo
synthetic animals like me never have a home
i'm not the one you will be walking through
and if you kill him for me
well then i'll kill him for you

i'll meet you down at the metro station
hah cause motherfucker's got my motivation
now i'm gonna show you how much i love you
oh my magazine is full of ugly things

don't need this system
we can kill them if we try
shoot up everything we see
and we'll find it on the wall
i hope you die

manipulation just to form an alibi
you're the prototype for me
and if heaven wants to take us they can try

oh ah

sometimes i sleep
i like to talk about television
oh i'm not so glad right now
heartbreak heartbeats
got the eyes on you
and give them something to say
'cause i got something to prove

i don't have much of an education
but i got a knack for elimination
now turn up the dial
hit the tyres that screech

let's go
right here
right now
this is the bonus stage

don't need this system
we can kill them if we try
shoot up everything we see
and we'll find it on the wall
i hope you die

manipulation
just to form an alibi
you're the prototype for me
and if heaven wants to take us they can try

i want annihilation
a new design for x and y
i want your violation
deflect the system with our mind
exterminate the dream
extermination you can buy

don't need this system
we can kill them if we try
shoot up everything we see
and we'll find it on the wall
i hope you die

manipulation just to form an alibi
you're the prototype for me
and if heaven wants to take us they can

i hate you
kill everybody

i hate you
kill everybody

they wanna grip the cross
make cavities
and just because it purely is a crime
we full-on freak the cops that causality 
and break the walls of cryogenic slime

she said come on come on kiss my battery
come on come on i’ll be your android girl
she said come on come on kiss my battery
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world

turn up the fades and lies just dance with me
you stare me down and take my only guise
they need the ones you got
and laugh for me
destroy the council where your mother cries

she said come on come on kiss my battery
come on come on i’ll be your android girl
she said come on come on lick that battery
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world

we all gotta die
but tonight we’d sell our skins to get you out
we all gotta try
i’ll be red with another arms
with another slide
i don’t wanna know i don’t wanna go
i don’t gotta know where i’m gonna die
i don’t wanna know i don’t wanna go
i don’t gotta know where i’m gonna die

scratch them all
spit casually
a heart
you got it in the one you need
i’m at a loss because of tragedy
for what you got i got the ones you need
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come come on just spit causally
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come come on just spit causally
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world

you can find out firsthand what it's like to be me
so gather 'round piggies and kiss this goodbye
i'd encourage your smiles i'll expect you won't cry

another contusion my funeral jag

(save me) too young to die and my dear
(you can't) if you can hear me just walk away and
(take me)

yeah

and if your heart stops beating
i'll be here wondering
did you get what you deserve
the ending of your life
and if you get to heaven
i'll be here waiting babe
did you get what you deserve
the end and if your life won't wait
then your heart can't take this

have you heard the news that you're dead
no one ever had much nice to say
i think they never liked you anyway
oh take me from the hospital bed
wouldn't it be grand it ain't exactly what you planned
and wouldn't it be great if we were dead 
ohh dead

tongue-tied and oh so squeamish
you never fell in love
did you get what you deserve
the ending of your life
and if you* get to heaven
i'll be here waiting babe
did you get what you deserve
the end and if your life won't wait
then your heart can't take this 

have you heard the news that you're dead
no one ever had much nice to say
i think they never liked you anyway
oh take me from the hospital bed
wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand
and wouldn't it be great if we were dead

and in my honest observation
during this operation
found a complication in your heart
so long 'cause now you've got (now you've got)
maybe just two weeks to live
is that the most the both of you can give

one two one two three four

if life ain't just a joke (la la la la la la la)
then why are we laughing
if life ain't just a joke (la la la la la)      
then why are we laughing (la la la la la la)   
if life ain't just a joke (la la la la la la la)
then why am i dead
dead



go

to un-explain the unforgivable
drain all the blood and give the kids a show
by streetlight this dark night
a séance down below
there're things that i have done 
you never should ever know

and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now
and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now

who walks among the famous living dead
drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
and if you could talk to me
tell me if it's so
that all the good girls go to heaven
well heaven knows

that without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now
and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now

can you hear me cry out to you
words i thought i'd choke on figure out
i'm really not so with you anymore
i'm just a ghost 
so i can't hurt you anymore
so i can't hurt you anymore

and now you wanna see how far down i can sink
let me go fuck
so you can well now so you can
i'm so far away from you
well now so you can

and without you is how i disappear
and without you is how i disappear
whoa whoa (and without you is how i disappear)
whoa whoa (and without you is how is how is how)
forever forever now

well it rains and it pours
when you're out on your own
if i crash on the couch
can i sleep in my clothes
'cause i've spent the night dancing
i'm drunk i suppose
if it looks like i'm laughing
i'm really just asking to leave

this alone you're in time for the show
you're the one that i need
i'm the one that you loathe
you can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
'cause i love all the poison
away with the boys in the band

i've really been on a bender and it shows
so why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes

give me a shot to remember
and you can take all the pain away from me
a kiss and i will surrender
the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
a light to burn all the empires
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
in love with all of these vampires
so you can leave like the sane abandoned me

there's a place in the dark where the animals go
you can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands romeo

i've really been on a bender and it shows
so why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes

give me a shot to remember
and you can take all the pain away from me
a kiss and i will surrender
the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
a light to burn all the empires
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
in love with all of these vampires
so you can leave like the sane abandoned me


when i was a young boy
my father took me into the city
to see a marching band

he said son when you grow up
would you be the saviour of the broken 
the beaten and the damned
he said will you defeat them
your demons and all the non-believers 
the plans that they have made
because one day i'll leave you
a phantom to lead you in the summer
to join the black parade

when i was a young boy
my father took me into the city
to see a marching band
he said son when you grow up
would you be the saviour of the broken 
the beaten and the damned

sometimes i get the feeling she's watching over me
and other times i feel like i should go
and through it all the rise and fall the bodies in the streets
and when you're gone we want you all to know

we'll carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on
we'll carry on
and in my heart i can't contain it
the anthem won't explain it

a world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
your misery and hate will kill us all
so paint it black and take it back
let's shout it loud and clear
defiant to the end we hear the call

to carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches

on and on we carry through the fears
ooh oh ohhhh
disappointed faces of your peers
ooh oh ohhhh
take a look at me cause i could not care at all

do or die you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try you'll never break me
we want it all we wanna play this part
i won't explain or say i'm sorry
i'm unashamed i'm gonna show my scar
give a cheer for all the broken
listen here because it's who we are
i'm just a man i'm not a hero
just a boy who had to sing this song
i'm just a man i'm not a hero
i don't care

we'll carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches on

do or die you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try you'll never break me
we want it all we wanna play this part (we'll carry on)

do or die you'll never make me (we'll carry on)
because the world will never take my heart (we'll carry on)
go and try you'll never break me (we'll carry)
we want it all we wanna play this part (we'll carry on)

well when you go
don't ever think i'll make you try to stay
and maybe when you get back 
i'll be off to find another way

and after all this time that you still owe 
you're still the good-for-nothing i don't know
so take your gloves and get out
better get out 
while you can

when you go
would you even turn to say
i don't love you
like i did
yesterday

sometimes i cry so hard from pleading
so sick and tired of all the needless beating
but baby when they knock you
down and out
it's where you oughta stay

and after all the blood that you still owe
another dollar's just another blow
so fix your eyes and get up 
better get up
while you can
whoa whooa

when you go
would you even turn to say
i don't love you
like i did
yesterday

well come on come on

when you go
would you have the guts to say
i don't love you
like i loved you
yesterday

i don't love you 
like i loved you
yesterday

i don't love you
like i loved you 
yesterday

well i know a thing about contrition
because i got enough to spare
and i'll be granting your permission
'cause you haven't got a prayer
well i said hey hey hallelujah
i'm gonna come on sing the praise
and let the spirit come on through ya
we got innocence for days

well i think i'm gonna burn in hell
everybody burn the house right down

and say ha
what i wanna say
tell me i'm an angel
take this to my grave
tell me i'm a bad man
kick me like a stray
tell me i'm an angel
take this to my grave

(s-i-n i s-i-n
s-i-n i s-i-n
s-i-n i s-i-n
s-i-n i s-i-n)

you play ring around the ambulance
well like you never gave a care
so get the choir boys around you
it's a compliment i swear
and i said ashes to ashes we all fall down
i wanna hear you sing the praise
i said ashes to ashes we all fall down
we got innocence for days

well i think i'm gonna burn in hell
everybody burn the house right down

and say ha
what i wanna say
tell me i'm an angel
take this to my grave
tell me i'm a bad man
kick me like a stray
tell me i'm an angel
take this to my grave

you better run like the devil
'cause they're never gonna leave you alone

i'd maybe then sing you a song


you would cry out your eyes all along

we're damned after all
through fortune and flame we fall
and if you can stay then i'll show you the way
to return from the ashes you call

we all carry on (we all carry on)
when our brothers in arms are gone (when our brothers in arms are gone)
so raise your glass high
for tomorrow we die
and return from the ashes you call

there are these terrors and it's like it feels like as if somebody was gripping my
there are these terrors and it's like it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
like last night they are not like tremors they are worse than tremors there are these terrors
like last night they are not like tremors they are worse than tremors there are these terrors
and it's like it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat and squeezing and
it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat

some say now suffer all the children
and walk away a savior
or a madman and polluted
from gutter institutions
don't you breathe for me
undeserving of your sympathy
cause there ain't no way that i'm sorry for what i did

and through it all
how could you cry for me
cause i don't feel bad about it
so shut your eyes
kiss me goodbye
and sleep
just sleep

the hardest part is letting go of your dreams

a drink for the horror that i'm in
for the good guys and the bad guys
for the monsters that i've been
three cheers for tyranny
unapologetic apathy
cause there ain't no way that i'm coming back again

and through it all
how could you cry for me
cause i don't feel bad about it
so shut your eyes
kiss me goodbye
and sleep
just sleep

the hardest part's the awful things that i've seen

sometimes i see flames 
and sometimes i see people that i love dying and it's always

just sleep
just sleep
just sleep
just sleep
just sleep
just sleep

wake up
wake up
wake up
wake up
wake up



they're gonna clean up your looks
with all the lies in the books
to make a citizen out of you
because they sleep with a gun
and keep an eye on you son
so they can watch all the things you do

because the drugs never work
they're gonna give you a smirk
'cause they got methods of keeping you clean
they're gonna rip up your heads
your aspirations to shreds
another cog in the murder machine

they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone but not me

the boys and girls in the clique
the awful names that they stick
you're never gonna fit in much kid
but if you're troubled and hurt
what you got under your shirt
will make them pay for the things that they did

they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone but not me

ohhh yeah

they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone but not me

all together now

teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone but not me


well i was there on the day
they sold the cause for the queen
and when the lights all went out
we watched our lives on the screen
i hate the ending myself 
but it started with an alright scene

it was the roar of the crowd
that gave me heartache to sing
it was a lie when they smiled
and said 
and as we ran from the cops
we laughed so hard it would sting

yeah yeah oh

if i'm so wrong (so wrong so wrong)
how can you listen all night long (night long night long)
now will it matter after i'm gone
because you never learn a goddamned thing

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya

i spent my high school career
spit on and shoved to agree
so i could watch all my heroes
sell a car on tv
bring out the old guillotine 
we'll show 'em what we all mean

yeah yeah oh

if i'm so wrong (so wrong so wrong)
how can you listen all night long (night long night long)
now will it matter long after i'm gone
because you never learn a goddamned thing

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya

so go go away just go run away
but where did you run to and where did you hide
go find another way price you pay

woah woah woah woah woah woah 

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya come on

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya

at all at all at all at all

now i know 
that i can't make you stay
but where's your heart
but where's your heart
but where's your

and i know
there's nothing i can say
to change that part

to change

so many
bright lights they cast a shadow
but can i speak
well is it hard understanding
i'm incomplete
a life that's so demanding
i get so weak
a love that's so demanding
i can't speak

i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone 
honey if you stay i'll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home

can you see
my eyes are shining bright
'cause i'm out here
on the other side
of a jet black hotel mirror
and i'm so weak
is it hard understanding
i'm incomplete
a love that's so demanding
i get weak

i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone 
honey if you stay i'll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home

i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone 
honey if you stay i'll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home

these bright lights have always blinded me
these bright lights have always blinded me
i say

i see you lying next to me
with words i thought i'd never speak
awake and unafraid
asleep or dead

(how can i see i see you lying) 'cause i see you lying next to me
(how can i see i see you lying) with words i thought i'd never speak
(how can i see i see you lying) awake and unafraid

well they encourage your complete cooperation
send you roses when they think you need to smile
i can't control myself because i don't know how
and they love me for it honestly i'll be here for a while

so give them blood blood gallons of the stuff
give them all that they can drink and it will never be enough
so give them blood blood blood
grab a glass because there's going to be a flood

a celebrated man amongst the gurneys
they can fix me proper with a bit of luck
the doctors and the nurses they adore me so
but it's really quite alarming cause i'm such an awful fuck (oh thank you)

i gave you blood blood gallons of the stuff
i gave you all that you can drink and it has never been enough
i gave you blood blood blood
i'm the kind of human wreckage that you love

long ago 
just like the hearse you die to get in again 
we are so far from you 

burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate 
the lives of everyone you know 
and what's the worst you take (worst you take)
from every heart you break (heart you break)
and like the blade you stain (blade you stain)
well i've been holding on tonight

what's the worst that i can say
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 

came a time 
when every star fall brought you to tears again 
we are the very hurt you sold 
and what's the worst you take (worst you take)
from every heart you break (heart you break)
and like the blade you stain (blade you stain)
well i've been holding on tonight 

what's the worst that i can say 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 
and if you carry on this way 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 

can you hear me 
are you near me 
can we pretend to leave and then
we'll meet again
when both our cars collide

what's the worst that i can say 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 
and if you carry on this way 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight

oh baby here comes the sound
i took a train outta new orleans and they shot me full of ephedrine
this is how we like to do it in the murder scene
can we settle up the score


if you were here i'd never have a fear
so go on live your life
but i miss you more than i did yesterday

you're beautiful

well i'm a total wreck and almost every day
like the firing squad or the mess you made
well don't i look pretty walking down the street 
in the best damn dress i own


if you were here i'd never have a fear
so go on live your life
but i miss you more than i did yesterday
you're so far away
so c'mon show me how
'cause i mean this more than words can ever say

some might say we are made from the sharpest things you say 
we are young and we don't care (oh whoa ow)
your dreams and your hopeless hair (oh whoa ow)
we never wanted it to be this way
for all our lives
do you care {at all}


if you were here i'd never have a fear
so go on live your life
but i miss you more than i did yesterday
you're so far away
so c'mon show me how
'cause i mean this more than words can ever say

(what'd you call me)
(well there's no way i'm kissing that guy)

he calls the mansion not a house but a tomb
he's always choking from the stench and the fume
the wedding party all collapsed in the room
so send my resignation to the bride and the groom
let's go down
this elevator only goes up to ten
he's not around
he's always looking at men
down by the pool
he doesn't have many friends
as they are
face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens

if you marry me
would you bury me
would you carry me to the end

(so say goodbye) to the vows you take
(and say goodbye) to the life you make
(and say goodbye) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

she keeps a picture of the body she lends
got nasty blisters from the money she spends
she's got a life of her own and it shows by the benz
she drives at 90 by the barbies and kens
if you ever say never too late 
i'll forget all the diamonds you ate
lost in coma and covered in cake
increase the medication
share the vows at the wake
(kiss the bride)

if you marry me
would you bury me
would you carry me to the end

(so say goodbye) to the vows you take
(and say goodbye) to the life you make
(and say goodbye) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

(and say goodbye) to the last parade
(and walk away) from the choice you made 
(and say goodnight) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

(so say goodbye) to the vows you take
(and say goodbye) to the life you make
(and say goodbye) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

(and say goodbye) to the last parade
(and walk away) from the choice you made
(and say goodnight) to the heart you break 
and all the cyanide you drank

to the last parade
when the parties fade
and the choice you made
to the end

in the middle of a gun fight 
in the center of a restaurant 
they say  
well they're never gonna get me 
like a bullet through a flock of doves 
to wage this war against your faith in me 
your lifewill never be the same 
on your mother's eyes say a prayersay a prayer

and i don't know 
how we're just two men as god had made us 
well i can'twell i can 
too much too late or just not enough of this 
pain in my heart for your dying wish 
i'll kiss your lips again

but nobody cares if you're losing yourselfam i losing myself 
well i miss my mom

or lethal injection or swing from a rope if you dare;

'cause i'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire (fire)

and well i i won't go down by myself 
but i'll go down with my friends 
now now now now (i can't explain)

well if you wanted honesty that's all you had to say
i never want to let you down or have you go it's better off this way
for all the dirty looks the photographs your boyfriend took
remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor

i'm not okay
i'm not okay
i'm not okay
you wear me out

what will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems
(i'm not okay)
i've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(i'm not okay)
to be a joke and look another line without a hook
i held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look

i'm not okay
i'm not okay
i'm not okay

i'd sometimes stare for hours (sometimes stare for hours)

she bought the last line
i'm just the worst kind
of guy to argue
with what you might find
and for the last night i lie
could i lie with you

alright give up get down
it's just the hardest part of living
alright she wants
it all to come down this time

lost in the prescription 
she's got something else in mind (something else in mind)

it gives the blind sight
until the cops come
or by the last light
and for the last night i lie

and you never had a chance

a pretty face but you do so carry on 
and on 
and on 
 
i wouldn't front the scene if you paid me 
i'm just the way that the doctor made me on 
and on 
and on 
and on 
love is the red the rose on your coffin door 
what's life like bleeding on the floor 
the floor

you'll never make me leave 
i wear this on my sleeve 
give me a reason to believe 
 

so give me all your poison 
and give me all your pills 
and give me all your hopeless hearts 
and make me ill 
you're running after something 
that you'll never kill 
if this is what you want 
then fire at will 
 
preach all you want but who's gonna save me 
i keep a gun on the book you gave me hallelujah lock and load 
black is the kiss the touch of the serpent son 
it ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one
and one 
and one 
and one 
 
you'll never make me leave 
i wear this on my sleeve 
give me a reason to believe 
 

so give me all your poison 
and give me all your pills 
and give me all your hopeless hearts 
and make me ill

then fire at will

wait until it fades to black
ride into the sunset
would i lie to you
well i've got something to say
grab your six-gun from your back
throttle the ignition
would i die for you
well here's your answer in spades

shotgun sinners
wild eyed jokers
got you in my sights
gun it while i'm holding on

after all is said and done
climb out from the pine box
well i'm asking you
'cause she's got nothing to say
the angels just cut out her tongue
call her black mariah
would i lie to you
that girl's not right in the brain

mass convulsions
strike the choir
by the grace of god
gun it while i'm holding on

but don't stop if i fall
and don't look back
oh baby don't stop 
bury me and fade to black

she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
so get your gun and meet me by the door 


she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
so baby

don't stop if i fall
and don't look back
oh baby don't stop
bury me and fade to black 


well don't stop

for what you did to me
and what i'll do to you
you get what everyone else gets
you get a lifetime

let's go

do you remember that day when we met
you told me this gets harder
well it did
been holding on forever
promise me that when i'm gone you'll kill my enemies
the damage you've inflicted temporary wounds
i'm coming back from the dead and i'll take you home with me
i'm taking back the life you stole

we never got that far
this helps me to think all through the night
bright lights that won't kill me now or tell me how
just you and i your starless eyes remain

hip hip hooray for me you talk to me but would you kill me in my sleep
lay still like the dead
from the razor to the rosary
we could lose ourselves
and paint these walls in pitchfork red

i will avenge my ghost with every breath i take
i'm coming back from the dead and i'll take you home with me
i'm taking back the life you stole

this hole you put me in
wasn't deep enough
and i'm climbing out right now
you're running out of places to hide from me
when you go
just know that i will remember you
if living was the hardest part
we'll then one day be together
and in the end we'll fall apart
just like the leaves change in colors
and then i will be with you
i will be there one last time now

when you go
just know that i will remember you

i've lost my fear of falling
i will be with you
i will be with you

this night walk the dead 
in a solitary style
and crash the cemetery gates 
in the dress your husband hates
way down mark the grave
where the search lights find us
drinking by the mausoleum door
and they found you on the bathroom floor

i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

back home off the run
singing songs that make you slit your wrists
it isn't that much fun staring down a loaded gun
so i won't stop dying won't stop lying (are you there at all)
if you want i'll keep on crying (do you care at all)
did you get what you deserve (are you there at all)
is this what you always want me for

i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

way down way down 
way down way down 
way down way down 
way down way down 

i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

when will i miss you when will i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
made it so hard

way down way down
way down way down 
way down way down
way down way down
way down

stay out of the light
or the photograph that i gave you
you can say a prayer if you need to
or just get in line and i'll grieve you
can i meet you alone
another night and i'll see you
another night and i'll be you
some other way to continue
to hide my face

another knife in my hands
a stain that never comes off the sheets
clean me off
i'm so dirty babe
the kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
i keep a book of the names and those

only go so far 'til you bury them
so deep and down we go

touched by angels though i fall out of grace
i did it all so maybe i'd live this every day

another knife in my hands
a stain that never comes off the sheets
clean me off
i'm so dirty babe
it ain't the money and it sure as hell ain't just for the fame
it's for the bodies i claim and lose

only go so far 'til you bury them
so deep and down we go 

down 

and down we go 
and down we go 
and down we go 
and we all fall down

i tried 
i tried

and we'll all dance alone to the tune of your death
we'll love again we'll laugh again
and it's better off this way

and never again and never again
they gave us two shots to the back of the head
and we're all dead now

well never again and never again
they gave us two shots to the back of the head
and we're all dead now

well i tried
one more night
one more night 
well i'm laughin' out cryin' out laughin' out loud
i tried well i tried well i tried 
'cause i tried but i lied
i lied

i tried 
i tried 
i tried well

and we'll love again we'll laugh again 
we'll cry again and we'll dance again
and it's better off this way 
so much better off this way 
i can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed 

and never again and never again
they gave us two shots to the back of the head 
and we're all dead now

i said we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
white lies you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time

just give us war-worn lipstick blood and purifying flame

these eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
black skies we'll douse ourselves in high explosive light

just give us war-worn i've been calling you all week for my shotgun

pick up the phone
pick up the phone fucker

i wanna see what your insides look like (i wanna see what your insides look like)
i bet you're not fucking pretty on the inside (not so pretty)
i wanna see what your insides look like (not so pretty baby)
i wanna see 'em (not so)

well you don't say
and well i can explain what happened to my faith
late last night
i sleep in empty pools and vacant alleyways
and what i'm going through shot lipgloss through my veins
and when i can't complain
with the falling rain

c'mon

i wanna save your heart
i wanna see what your insides may be

the amount of pills i'm taking counteracts the booze i'm drinking
and this vanity i'm breaking lets me live my life like this
and well i find it hard to stay with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in
well i'll choose the life i've taken never mind the friends i'm making
and the beauty that i'm faking lets me live my life like this
and well i find it hard to stay with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in

and you can cry all you want to i don't care how much
you'll invest yourself in me we're not working out (we're not working out)
we're not working out (we're not working out)
and you can't touch my brother and you can't keep my friends
and we're not working out we're not working out
this time i mean it never mind the times i've seen it

well i hope i'm not mistaken by the news i heard from waking
and it's hard to say i'm shaken by the choices that i make
and well i find it hard to stay with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in
well i'll choose this life i've taken never mind the friends i'm making
and i get a little shaken because i live my life like this
and well i find it hard to stay with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in

and you can cry all you want to i don't care how much
you'll invest yourself in me we're not working out 
we're not working out
and you can't keep my brother and you won't fuck my friends
and we're not working out we're not working out
this time i mean it never mind the times i've seen it

never again never never again

(and you can cry all you want to i don't care how much you'll invest yourself in me)
ne never never never again 
(and you can cry all you want to i don't care how much you'll invest yourself)
ne never never oh baby let me oh baby oh baby

oh baby let me in 
i'm knocking let me in 
oh baby let me in 
oh baby let me in 
i'm knocking let me in

oh baby let me in

and if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground
and if they get me take this spike to my heart and
and if they get me and the sun goes down
and if they get me take this spike and
you put the spike in my heart

and if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones
and then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks i saw you there
someone get me to the doctor someone get me to a church
where they can pump this venom gaping hole
and you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
and if they come and get me
what if you put the spike in my heart

and if they get me and the sun goes down
and if they get me take this spike and

(come on)


can you take this spike
will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
night time sky
can you take this spike
will it wash away this jet black feeling

and now the nightclub sets the stage for this they come in pairs she said
we'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there
someone get me to the doctor and someone call the nurse
and someone buy me roses and someone burned the church
we're hanging out with corpses and driving in this hearse
and someone save my soul tonight please save my soul


can you take this spike
will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
night time sky
can you take this spike
will it wash away this jet black now

(let's go come on)

and as these days watch over time and as these days watch over time
and as these days watch over us tonight


i'll never let them i'll never let them
i'll never let them hurt you not tonight
i'll never let them i can't forget them
i'll never let them hurt you i promise

struck down before our prime
before you got off the floor
can you stake my heart can you stake my heart

can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
(and these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light 
and this venom from my heart)

can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
(and these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light 
kill this venom from my heart)

can you stake me before the sun goes down

(and as always innocent like roller coasters
fatality is like ghosts in snow and you have no idea what you're up against 
because i've seen what they look like 
becoming perfect as if they were sterling silver chainsaws going cascading)

without a sound i took her down
and dressed in red and blue i squeezed
imaginary wedding gown
that you can't wear in front of me
a kiss goodbye your twisted shell
as rice grains and roses fall at your feet
lets say goodbye the hundredth time
and then tomorrow we'll do it again
tomorrow we'll do it again

i dragged her down i put her out
and back there i left her where no one could see
and lifeless cold into this well
i stared as this moment was held for me
a kiss goodbye your twisted shell
as rice grains and roses fall at your feet
let's say goodbye the hundredth time
and then tomorrow we'll do it again

i never thought it'd be this way
just me and you we're here alone
and if you stay all i'm asking for is
a thousand bodies piled up
i never thought would be enough
to show you just what i've been thinking

and i'll keep on making more
just to prove that i adore
every inch of sanity
all i'm asking for is all i'm asking for is

c'mon

these hands stained red
from the times that i've killed you and then
we can wash down this engagement ring
with poison and kerosene
we'll laugh as we die
and we'll celebrate the end of things
with cheap champagne

without without a sound 
and i wish you away
without a sound
and i wish you away

without a sound without a sound
and i wish you away


we could be perfect one last night
and die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
and we can settle this affair
if you would shed your yellow take my hand
and then we'll solve the mystery of laceration gravity
this riddle of revenge please understand it has to be this way

stand up fucking tall
don't let them see your back
and take my fucking hand
and never be afraid again

we've only got one chance to put this at an end
and cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
you said we're not celebrities we spark and fade they die by threes
i'll make you understand and you can trade me for an apparition

stand up fucking tall
don't let them see your back
and take my fucking hand
and never

trust you said
who put the words in your head
oh how wrong we were to think
that immortality meant never dying

stand
take my fucking hand
take my fucking

stand up fucking tall
don't let them see your back
and take my fucking hand
and never be afraid again

just because my hands are round your throat

yeah

well let's go back to the middle of the day that starts it all
i can't begin to let you know just what i'm feeling
and now the red ones make me fly
and the blue ones help me fall
and i think i'll blow my brains against the ceiling
and as the fragments of my skull begin to fall
fall on your tongue like pixie dust just think happy thoughts


and we'll fly home
we'll fly home
you and i
we'll fly home

come on

well now i'm back in the middle of the day that starts it all
i can't begin to let you know just what i'm feeling
and now these red ones make me fly
and the blue ones help me fall
and i think i'll blow my brains against the ceiling


and we'll fly home
you and i
we'll fly home

now honestly that's what i said to her what i said to her

think happy thoughts 
think ha wooo

you're not in this alone
let me break this awkward silence
let me go go on record
be the first to say i'm sorry
hear me out 
and if you take me down
or would you lay me out
and if the world needs something better
let's give them one more reason now now now

we walk in single file
we light our rails and punch our time
ride escalators colder than a cell


this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes
hello angel tell me where are you
tell me where we go from here


tell me we go from

and in this moment we can't close the lids on burning eyes
our memories blanket us with friends we know like fallout vapors
steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun scorched and black
it reaches in and tears your flesh apart
as ice cold hands rip into your heart

that's if you've still got one that's left inside that cave you call a chest
and after seeing what we saw can we still reclaim our innocence
and if the world needs something better let's give them one more reason now


this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes
hello angel tell me where are you
tell me where we go from here


tell me we go from here

late dawns and early sunsets just like my favorite scenes
then holding hands and life was perfect just like up on the screen
and the whole time while always giving
counting your face among the living

up and down escalators pennies and colder fountains
elevators and half price sales trapped in by all these mountains
running away and hiding with you
i never thought they'd get me here
not knowing you'd change from just one bite
i fought them all off just to hold you close and tight

but does anyone notice 
but does anyone care 
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
but would anything matter if you're already dead 
and well should i be shocked now by the last thing you said 
before i pull this trigger 
your eyes vacant and stained

but does anyone notice 
but does anyone care 
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
and would anything matter if you're already dead 
and now should i be shocked by the last thing you said 
before i pull this trigger 
your eyes vacant and stained
and in saying you loved me
made things harder at best
and these words changing nothing
as your body remains
and there's no room in this hell
there's no room in the next
and our memories defeat us
and i'll end this direst

but does anyone notice 
but does anyone care 
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
but does anything matter if you're already dead
and should i be shocked now by the last thing you said
before i pull this trigger
your eyes vacant and stained
and in saying you loved me
made things harder at best
and these words changing nothing
as your body remains
and there's no room in this hell 
there's no room in the next
but does anyone notice there's a corpse in this bed

and we can run from the backdrop of these gears and scalpels
at every hour goes the tick-tock bang of monitors as
they stared us down when we met in the emergency room
and in our beds i could hear you breathe with help from cold machines

every hour on the hour they drew blood

well i felt i couldn't take another day inside this place
from silent dreams we never wake and in this promise that we'll make
starless eyes for heaven's sake but i hear you anyway
well i thought i heard you
say i like you we can get out
we don't have to stay stay inside this place

someday this day we kept falling down
someday this day set the ferris wheel ablaze
you left my heart an open wound
and i love you for
this day someday we kept falling down
one day this day all we had to keep us safe
and if we never sleep again it would never end
well i thought i heard you say to me
we'll go so far far as we can
and i just can't stay one day we'll run away

it's the tearing sound of love-notes
drowning out these gray stained windows
and the view outside is sterile
and i'm only two cubes down
i'd photocopy all the things that we could be
if you took the time to notice me
but you can't now i don't blame you
and it's not your fault that no one ever does


but you don't work here anymore
it's just a vacant three by four
and they might fill your place
a temporary stand-in for your face
this happens all the time
and i can't help but think i'll die alone

so i'll spend my time with strangers
a condition and it's terminal
in this water-cooler romance
and it's coming to a close
we could be in the park and dancing by a tree
kicking over blades we see
or a dark beach with a black view
and pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall



i know you don't work here anymore 

sometimes i think i'll die alone sometimes i think i'll die alone
sometimes i think i'll die alone live and breathe and die alone
sometimes i think i'll die alone sometimes i think i'll die alone
sometimes i think i'll die alone i'd think i'd love to die alone

just take
i think i'd love to die
me down
i think i'd love to die
just take
i think i'd love to die
me down
i think i'd love to die alone 
live and breathe and die alone
i think i'd love to die alone 

i think i'd love to die alone

hand in mine into your icy blues
and then i'd say to you we could take to the highway
with this trunk of ammunition too
i'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets

i'm trying i'm trying
to let you know just how much you mean to me
and after all the things we put each other through and

i would drive on to the end with you
a liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
and i feel like there's nothing left to do
but prove myself to you and we'll keep it running

but this time i mean it
i'll let you know just how much you mean to me
as snow falls on desert sky
until the end of everything
i'm trying i'm trying
to let you know how much you mean
as days fade and nights grow
and we go cold

until the end until this pool of blood
until this i mean this i mean this
until the end of

i'm trying i'm trying
to let you know how much you mean
as days fade and nights grow
and we go cold

but this time we'll show them
we'll show them all how much we mean
as snow falls on desert sky
until the end of every

all we are all we are
is bullets i mean this


as lead rains will pass on through our phantoms
forever forever
like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning
forever and ever
know how much i want to show you you're the only one
like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun

and as we're falling down and in this pool of blood
and as we're touching hands and as we're falling down
and in this pool of blood and as we're falling down
i'll see your eyes and in this pool of blood
i'll meet your eyes i mean this forever

she came from greece she had a thirst for knowledge
she studied sculpture at st martin's college
that's where i
caught her eye

she told me that her dad was loaded
i said 
she said 
and then in thirty seconds time she said

i want to live like common people
i want to do whatever common people do
i want to sleep with common people
i want to sleep with common people like you

oh what else could i do
i said 

i took her to a supermarket
i don't know why but i had to start it somewhere
so it started there
i said 
but she just laughed an said 
i said yeah
well i can't see anyone else smiling in here

are you sure you want to live like common people
you want to see whatever common people see
you want to sleep with common people
you want to sleep with common people like me

but she didn't understand
she just smiled and held my hand

rent a flat above a shop
cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool
pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right
`cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall
if you called your dad he could stop it all yeah

you'll never live like common people
you'll never do what ever common people do
you'll never fail like common people
you'll never watch your life slide out of view

and then dance and drink and screw
because there's nothing else to do

sing along with the common people
sing along and it might just get you through
laugh along with the common people
laugh along even though they're laughing at you
and the stupid things that you do
because you think that poor is cool

like a dog lying in a corner
they will bite you and never warn you
look out

they'll tear your insides out

`cos everybody hates a tourist
especially one who thinks it's all such a laugh
yeah and the chip stain and grease will come out in the bath

you will never understand
how it feels to live your life
with no meaning or control
and with nowhere left to go
you are amazed that they exist
and they burn so bright whilst you can only wonder why

rent a flat above a shop
cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool
pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right
`cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall
if you called your dad he could stop it all yeah

never live like common people
never do what common people do
never fail like common people
never watch your life slide out of view

and then dance and drink and screw
because there's nothing else to do

i want to live with common people like you

we hold in our hearts the sword and the faith
swelled up from the rain clouds move like a wraith
well after all we'll lie another day
and through it all we'll find some other way
to carry on through cartilage and fluid
and did you come to stare or wash away the blood

well tonight well tonight
will it ever come
spend the rest of your days rocking out 
just for the dead
well tonight
will it ever come
i can see you awake anytime in my head
 
did we all fall down 
did we all fall down
did we all fall down
did we all fall down
from the lights to the pavement
from the van to the floor
from backstage to the doctor
from the earth to the morgue morgue morgue morgue

well tonight
will it ever come
spend the rest of your days rocking out 
just for the dead
well tonight 
will it ever come
i can see you awake anytime in my head

all fall down
well after all

they're selling postcards of the hanging
well they're painting the passports brown
and the beauty parlor's filled with sailors
the circus is in town

oh now look here comes the blind commissioner
well they got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
the other's in his pants

and the riot squad they're restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row

cinderella she seem so easy
 she smiles
and she puts her hands in her back pockets
oh bette davis style

and now here comes romeo moaning

and someone says you're in the wrong place my friend
you better leave

and then the only sound that's left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweepin' up
on desolation row

now at midnight all the agents
and superhuman crew
go out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
(knows more than they do)

they're gonna bring 'em to the factory
where the heart-attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene

is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that no one is escaping
to desolation row

'cause right now i can't read too good
don't send me no letters no
not unless you're gonna mail them
from desolation row

another sad song with nothing to say 
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
if you believe that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to you
i waited so long for someone to say
if you can move on
i'll never get you to stay 
if you believe that i'm wrong
this never meant nothing to you
another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
if you believe that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to you

and if you hold on
and need me to stay
you get the hard thoughts
oh baby just the mistakes 
maybe we'll just
shut up and play
it never did mean nothing to you
never did mean

another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
if you believe that i'm wrong
this never meant nothing to you

if you would hold on
and need me to stay
you get the hard thoughts
oh baby just the mistakes 
we never really got too much anyways
yeah yeah yeah just go

just go run away
where did you run
don't fight it just run away
let it go
and when you go run don't walk
and when you sing scream don't talk

another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long
wait for a hospital stay
we never really got too much anyways

another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
maybe we'll just shut up and play
you never really got it
no you never really got it at all

every snowflake's different just like you
i'll sing about it if you ask me to
different shapes and different size like
every star up in the sky
every snowflake's different just like you

green fur
blue skin
and the very silly way you grin
big fangs
small chin
there's so many special things about you
things about you
things about you

every snowflake's different just like
every snowflake's different just like
every snowflake's different just like you
different shapes and different size like
every star up in the sky
every snowflake's different just like you

some people watch some people pray
but even lights can fade away
some people hope some people pay
but why we have to stay

cause even heroes get the blues
or any misery you choose
you like to watch we like to use
and we were born to lose

i choose defeat i walk away
and leave this place the same today
some like to sleep we like to play
just look at all that pain

you want the heart or to be saved
but even good guys still get paid
so watch my back and keep the blade
i think it got you laid

so fake your death or it's your blame
and leave the lights on when you stay
take off your clothes and dream and fade
come on and feel that shame

i choose defeat i walk away
and leave this place the same today
some like to sleep we like to play
just look at all that pain

just look at all that pain

just look at all that pain
just look at all that pain
just give me all that pain
just give me all that pain
just give me all that pain

i choose defeat i walk away
and leave this place the same today
some like to sleep we like to play
just look at all that pain

some folks are born made to wave the flag
ooh the red white and blue
and when the band plays hail to the chief
ooh they point the cannon at you lord

it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no senators son son
it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no fortunate one no

yeah
some folks are born silver spoon in hand
lord don't they help themselves oh
but when the taxman comes to the door
lord the house looks like a rummage sale yes

it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no millionaires son no
it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no fortunate one no

some folks inherit star spangled eyes
ooh they send you down to war lord
and when you ask them how much should we give 
ooh they only answer more more more yoh

it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no military son son
it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no fortunate one one

it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no fortunate one no no no
it ain't me it ain't me
i ain't no fortunate son no no no

hear the sound 
the angels come screaming 
down your voice 
i hear you've been bleeding 

make your choice 
they say you've been pleading
someone save us 

heaven help us now 
come crashing down 
we'll hear the sound 
as you're falling down 

i'm at this old hotel
but can't tell if i've been breathing or sleeping 
or screaming or waiting for the man to call 
and maybe all of the above 
cause mostly i've been sprawled on these cathedral steps 
while spitting out the blood and screaming 


heaven help us now 
come crashing down 
we'll hear the sound 
as you're falling down 

and will you pray for me
or make a saint of me
and will you lay for me
or make a saint of

cause i'll give you all the nails you need 
cover me in gasoline 
wipe away those tears of blood again 
and the punchline to the joke is asking
someone save us 

heaven help us now 
come crashing down 
we'll hear the sound 
as you fall

and would you pray for me
(you don't know a thing about my sins
how the misery begins)
or make a saint of me
(you don't know
so i'm burning i'm burning)
and will you lay for me
(you don't know a thing about my sins
how the misery begins)
or make a saint
(you don't know
cause i'm burning i'm burning)

cause i'll give you all the nails you need 
(i'm burning i'm burning again)
cover me in gasoline again

and we are all about to sell it
'cause it's tragic with a capital t
let it be let it be let it be

'cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends
(ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba)
and we all get together when we bury our friends
(ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba)
it's been eight bitter years since i've been seeing your face
(ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba)
and you're walking away and i will die in this place

sometimes you scrape and sink so low
i'm shocked at what you're capable of
and if this is a coronation
i ain't feeling the love

'cause we are all a bunch of animals
that never paid attention in school
so tell me all about your problems;
i was killing before killing was cool
you're so cool you're so cool so cool

'cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends
(ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba)
and we all get together when we bury our friends

it's been nine bitter years since i've been seeing your face
(ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba)
and you're walking away and i will die in this place

you'll never take me alive

do what it takes to survive
'cause i'm still here
you'll never get me alive
you'll never take me alive
do what it takes to survive
and i'm still here
you'll never take me alive
you'll never get me alive
do what it takes to survive
and i'm still here
you'll never get me
(get me)
you'll never take me
(take me)
you'll never get me alive

'cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends
(ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba)
and we all get together when we bury our friends
it's been ten fucking years since i've been seeing 
your face 'round here
and you're walking away and i will drown in the fear

gonna take off all my skin
tear apart all of my insides
when they rifle in
mom and dad think you'll be saved
they never had the time
they're gonna medicate your lives
you were always born a crime
we salute you in your grave

can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know
what i'd do just to get back in her arms
can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know
what i'd do just to get back in her arms


(well my gun fires
seven different shades of shit
so what's your favorite color punk)

do you wanna hold my hand
could you sign this photograph
'cause i'm your biggest fan
would you leave me lying here

we're not here to pay a compliment
or sing about the government
oxycontin genocide
adolescent suicide
i'll give you my sincerity 
{don't give} a fuck about a kennedy
here's what i've got to say

can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know
what i'd do just to get back in her arms
can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know 
what i'd do just to get back in her arms

no way home why 


we've got to go 


can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know 
what i'd do just to get back in her arms
can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know 
what i'd do just to get back well in her arms

i can't find the way 


come on angel don't you cry 


be a man can a mystery man
or be a doll be a baby doll
it can't be fun not any way 
there can be found no way at all 
a distant man can't sympathise 
can't uphold his distant laws 
due to form on that today 
i got a feeling then i hear that call
i said 

neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon 
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat 

no crime if there ain't no law 
no more cops left to mess you around 
no more dreams of mystery chords 
no more sight to bring you down 

i got a crazy got a thought in my mind 
my mind's on when she falls asleep 
feelin' fine in her restless time 
then these words upon me creep i said

neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon 
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat

and all my hopes and dreams-
aren't for anyone 
i keep them safe and sound 

and all these victories-
not yours anymore 
well can you hear me now 

the dead stop dreaming-
i'll set ablaze this life 
your shadow keeps me bright 

so try and stop me-
or suffocate this light 
because i can burn all night 

until my heart stops beating 
you'll never hear me say-
i'm backing down 

if i say- 
it's lost it's meaning 
if i can't find my way-
it's over now 

but i won't 
walk away 

till the day 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
i'm never backing down 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
and hear me say 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
i'll keep it safe and- 

this hopeless feeling 
this fear of falling down-
but i'm not crashing now 

for all this bleeding 
it wasn't worth the sound-
of millions screaming out 

and still 
the end comes reeling 
the curtain calls my name-
i'm not afraid 

and i know 
you may not miss me 
but i am not ashamed-
the choice i've made 

but i can't let this go 

till the day 
woah-oh whoah-ooh 
i'm never backin down 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
just hear me say 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
i'll keep it safe and sound 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
i'll keep it safe and - 

like a crashing car or dying star 
that's racing to the ground 
like the final words of the passengers 
with the engines giving out 

will the world watch us burn 

til the day 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
i'm never backing down 
woah-oh woah-ooh 
just hear me say 
woah-oh woah-ooh
i'll keep it safe and sound
woah-oh woah-ooh
i'll keep it safe and sound
woah-oh woah-ooh
i'll keep it safe and sound
woah-oh woah-ooh
i'll keep it safe and sound
woah-oh woah-ooh 
i'll keep it safe and sound

couldn't you always love me
then you made me walk away

and would you stay right here
when i tell you
that someone out there loves you
if you stay right here
when i'd tell you
that someone out there loves you after all

sometimes these things can always be so small
sometimes you could hit right back
hold me down to catch this vision
watch me make that most of this
could you make me kiss you
when we decimate the stars

and would you stay right here
when i tell you
that someone out there loves you
stay right here
when i'm telling you
that someone out there loves you

if there is no one no one out there
is there no one no one who cares
if there is no one no one out there
is there no one like you to share
would you ask yourself
would you ask yourself

and would you stay right here
when i tell you
that someone out there loves you
if you stay right here stay right here
stay with me stay right here stay right here

pressing down on you no man ask for
under pressure
that burns a building down
splits a family in two
puts people on streets

it's the terror of knowing
what this world is about
watching some good friends
scream 
pray tomorrow takes me higher
pressure on people
people on streets

kick my brains round the floor
these are the days

keep coming up with love

insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
can't we give ourselves one more chance
why can't we give love that one more chance
why can't we give love give love give love
give love give love give love give love give love

cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care
for the people on the edge of the night
and love dares you to change our ways
of caring about ourselves

this is our last dance
this is our last dance
this is ourselves under pressure

so give me all you’ve got
i can take it
we walked around in your city lights
‘cause it makes me who i am
we lit the fire and it’s burning bright
not ashamed of what i am
i took the pills for these empty nights
‘cause it makes me who i am

they always told me that you never get to heaven
with a love like yours
well if you’re lost little boy
oh they'll give us both a ride back down yeah

‘cause the world don’t need another hopeless cause
though it makes me who i am
‘cause it makes me who i am
and you made me who i am
and you made me who i am
be afraid of what i am

i can take it
we walked around in your city lights
‘cause it makes me who i am
i'll wreck it all and i’ll do it fine
‘cause i’ll never fade away
if i steal the fire from your city nights
‘cause it makes me who i am
who i am

i said we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
white lies you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time

just give us war-worn lipstick blood and purifying flame

these eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
black skies we'll douse ourselves in high explosive light

just give us war-worn i've been calling you all week for my shotgun

pick up the phone
pick up the phone fucker

i wanna see what your insides look like (i wanna see what your insides look like)
i bet you're not fucking pretty on the inside (not so pretty)
i wanna see what your insides look like (not so pretty baby)
i wanna see 'em (not so)

well you don't say
and well i can explain what happened to my faith
late last night
i sleep in empty pools and vacant alleyways
and what i'm going through shot lipgloss through my veins
and when i can't complain
with the falling rain

c'mon

i wanna save your heart
i wanna see what your insides may be

turn away
if you could get me a drink 
of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded 
call my aunt marie
help her gather all my things
and bury me in all my favorite colors 
my sisters and my brothers still 
i will not kiss you 
'cause the hardest part of this is leaving you 

now turn away 
'cause i'm awful just to see 
'cause all my hairs abandoned all my body 
oh my agony 
know that i will never marry 
baby i'm just soggy from the chemo
but counting down the days to go
it just ain't living
and i just hope you know

that if you say (if you say)
goodbye today (goodbye today)
i'd ask you to be true (cause i'd ask you to be true)

'cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

this night walk the dead 
in a solitary style
and crash the cemetery gates 
in the dress your husband hates
way down mark the grave
where the search lights find us
drinking by the mausoleum door
and they found you on the bathroom floor

i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

back home off the run
singing songs that make you slit your wrists
it isn't that much fun staring down a loaded gun
so i won't stop dying won't stop lying (are you there at all)
if you want i'll keep on crying (do you care at all)
did you get what you deserve (are you there at all)
is this what you always want me for

i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

way down way down 
way down way down 
way down way down 
way down way down 

i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

when will i miss you when will i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
made it so hard

way down way down
way down way down 
way down way down
way down way down
way down

she came from greece she had a thirst for knowledge
she studied sculpture at st martin's college
that's where i
caught her eye

she told me that her dad was loaded
i said 
she said 
and then in thirty seconds time she said

i want to live like common people
i want to do whatever common people do
i want to sleep with common people
i want to sleep with common people like you

oh what else could i do
i said 

i took her to a supermarket
i don't know why but i had to start it somewhere
so it started there
i said 
but she just laughed an said 
i said yeah
well i can't see anyone else smiling in here

are you sure you want to live like common people
you want to see whatever common people see
you want to sleep with common people
you want to sleep with common people like me

but she didn't understand
she just smiled and held my hand

rent a flat above a shop
cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool
pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right
`cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall
if you called your dad he could stop it all yeah

you'll never live like common people
you'll never do what ever common people do
you'll never fail like common people
you'll never watch your life slide out of view

and then dance and drink and screw
because there's nothing else to do

sing along with the common people
sing along and it might just get you through
laugh along with the common people
laugh along even though they're laughing at you
and the stupid things that you do
because you think that poor is cool

like a dog lying in a corner
they will bite you and never warn you
look out

they'll tear your insides out

`cos everybody hates a tourist
especially one who thinks it's all such a laugh
yeah and the chip stain and grease will come out in the bath

you will never understand
how it feels to live your life
with no meaning or control
and with nowhere left to go
you are amazed that they exist
and they burn so bright whilst you can only wonder why

rent a flat above a shop
cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool
pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right
`cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall
if you called your dad he could stop it all yeah

never live like common people
never do what common people do
never fail like common people
never watch your life slide out of view

and then dance and drink and screw
because there's nothing else to do

i want to live with common people like you

it's the tearing sound of love-notes
drowning out these gray stained windows
and the view outside is sterile
and i'm only two cubes down
i'd photocopy all the things that we could be
if you took the time to notice me
but you can't now i don't blame you
and it's not your fault that no one ever does


but you don't work here anymore
it's just a vacant three by four
and they might fill your place
a temporary stand-in for your face
this happens all the time
and i can't help but think i'll die alone

so i'll spend my time with strangers
a condition and it's terminal
in this water-cooler romance
and it's coming to a close
we could be in the park and dancing by a tree
kicking over blades we see
or a dark beach with a black view
and pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall



i know you don't work here anymore 

sometimes i think i'll die alone sometimes i think i'll die alone
sometimes i think i'll die alone live and breathe and die alone
sometimes i think i'll die alone sometimes i think i'll die alone
sometimes i think i'll die alone i'd think i'd love to die alone

just take
i think i'd love to die
me down
i think i'd love to die
just take
i think i'd love to die
me down
i think i'd love to die alone 
live and breathe and die alone
i think i'd love to die alone 

i think i'd love to die alone

yeah

and if your heart stops beating
i'll be here wondering
did you get what you deserve
the ending of your life
and if you get to heaven
i'll be here waiting babe
did you get what you deserve
the end and if your life won't wait
then your heart can't take this

have you heard the news that you're dead
no one ever had much nice to say
i think they never liked you anyway
oh take me from the hospital bed
wouldn't it be grand it ain't exactly what you planned
and wouldn't it be great if we were dead 
ohh dead

tongue-tied and oh so squeamish
you never fell in love
did you get what you deserve
the ending of your life
and if you* get to heaven
i'll be here waiting babe
did you get what you deserve
the end and if your life won't wait
then your heart can't take this 

have you heard the news that you're dead
no one ever had much nice to say
i think they never liked you anyway
oh take me from the hospital bed
wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand
and wouldn't it be great if we were dead

and in my honest observation
during this operation
found a complication in your heart
so long 'cause now you've got (now you've got)
maybe just two weeks to live
is that the most the both of you can give

one two one two three four

la la la la la 
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
well come on 
la la la la la
la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la
oh motherfucker 

if life ain't just a joke (la la la la la)
then why are we laughing (la la la la la la)
if life ain't just a joke (la la la la la la la)
then why are we laughing
if life ain't just a joke (la la la la la)      
then why are we laughing (la la la la la la)   
if life ain't just a joke (la la la la la la la)
then why am i dead
dead



hand in mine into your icy blues
and then i'd say to you we could take to the highway
with this trunk of ammunition too
i'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets

i'm trying i'm trying
to let you know just how much you mean to me
and after all the things we put each other through and

i would drive on to the end with you
a liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
and i feel like there's nothing left to do
but prove myself to you and we'll keep it running

but this time i mean it
i'll let you know just how much you mean to me
as snow falls on desert sky
until the end of everything
i'm trying i'm trying
to let you know how much you mean
as days fade and nights grow
and we go cold

until the end until this pool of blood
until this i mean this i mean this
until the end of

i'm trying i'm trying
to let you know how much you mean
as days fade and nights grow
and we go cold

but this time we'll show them
we'll show them all how much we mean
as snow falls on desert sky
until the end of every

all we are all we are
is bullets i mean this


as lead rains will pass on through our phantoms
forever forever
like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning
forever and ever
know how much i want to show you you're the only one
like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun

and as we're falling down and in this pool of blood
and as we're touching hands and as we're falling down
and in this pool of blood and as we're falling down
i'll see your eyes and in this pool of blood
i'll meet your eyes i mean this forever

we hold in our hearts the sword and the faith
swelled up from the rain clouds move like a wraith
well after all we'll lie another day
and through it all we'll find some other way
to carry on through cartilage and fluid
and did you come to stare or wash away the blood

well tonight well tonight
will it ever come
spend the rest of your days rocking out 
just for the dead
well tonight
will it ever come
i can see you awake anytime in my head
 
did we all fall down 
did we all fall down
did we all fall down
did we all fall down
from the lights to the pavement
from the van to the floor
from backstage to the doctor
from the earth to the morgue morgue morgue morgue

well tonight
will it ever come
spend the rest of your days rocking out 
just for the dead
well tonight 
will it ever come
i can see you awake anytime in my head

all fall down
well after all

they're selling postcards of the hanging
well they're painting the passports brown
and the beauty parlor's filled with sailors
the circus is in town

oh now look here comes the blind commissioner
well they got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
the other's in his pants

and the riot squad they're restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row

cinderella she seem so easy
 she smiles
and she puts her hands in her back pockets
oh bette davis style

and now here comes romeo moaning

and someone says you're in the wrong place my friend
you better leave

and then the only sound that's left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweepin' up
on desolation row

now at midnight all the agents
and superhuman crew
go out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
(knows more than they do)

they're gonna bring 'em to the factory
where the heart-attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene

is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that no one is escaping
to desolation row

'cause right now i can't read too good
don't send me no letters no
not unless you're gonna mail them
from desolation row

check check
check check
check check check check check check check
check ch

with duct tape scars on my honey

well i was there on the day
they sold the cause for the queen
and when the lights all went out
we watched our lives on the screen
i hate the ending myself 
but it started with an alright scene

it was the roar of the crowd
that gave me heartache to sing
it was a lie when they smiled
and said 
and as we ran from the cops
we laughed so hard it would sting

yeah yeah oh

if i'm so wrong (so wrong so wrong)
how can you listen all night long (night long night long)
now will it matter after i'm gone
because you never learn a goddamned thing

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya

i spent my high school career
spit on and shoved to agree
so i could watch all my heroes
sell a car on tv
bring out the old guillotine 
we'll show 'em what we all mean

yeah yeah oh

if i'm so wrong (so wrong so wrong)
how can you listen all night long (night long night long)
now will it matter long after i'm gone
because you never learn a goddamned thing

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya

so go go away just go run away
but where did you run to and where did you hide
go find another way price you pay

woah woah woah woah woah woah 

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya come on

you're just a sad song with nothing to say 
about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to ya

at all at all at all at all

another sad song with nothing to say 
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
if you believe that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to you
i waited so long for someone to say
if you can move on
i'll never get you to stay 
if you believe that i'm wrong
this never meant nothing to you
another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
if you believe that i'm wrong 
this never meant nothing to you

and if you hold on
and need me to stay
you get the hard thoughts
oh baby just the mistakes 
maybe we'll just
shut up and play
it never did mean nothing to you
never did mean

another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
if you believe that i'm wrong
this never meant nothing to you

if you would hold on
and need me to stay
you get the hard thoughts
oh baby just the mistakes 
we never really got too much anyways
yeah yeah yeah just go

just go run away
where did you run
don't fight it just run away
let it go
and when you go run don't walk
and when you sing scream don't talk

another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long
wait for a hospital stay
we never really got too much anyways

another sad song with nothing to say
about a life-long wait for a hospital stay
maybe we'll just shut up and play
you never really got it
no you never really got it at all

without a sound i took her down
and dressed in red and blue i squeezed
imaginary wedding gown
that you can't wear in front of me
a kiss goodbye your twisted shell
as rice grains and roses fall at your feet
lets say goodbye the hundredth time
and then tomorrow we'll do it again
tomorrow we'll do it again

i dragged her down i put her out
and back there i left her where no one could see
and lifeless cold into this well
i stared as this moment was held for me
a kiss goodbye your twisted shell
as rice grains and roses fall at your feet
let's say goodbye the hundredth time
and then tomorrow we'll do it again

i never thought it'd be this way
just me and you we're here alone
and if you stay all i'm asking for is
a thousand bodies piled up
i never thought would be enough
to show you just what i've been thinking

and i'll keep on making more
just to prove that i adore
every inch of sanity
all i'm asking for is all i'm asking for is

c'mon

these hands stained red
from the times that i've killed you and then
we can wash down this engagement ring
with poison and kerosene
we'll laugh as we die
and we'll celebrate the end of things
with cheap champagne

without without a sound 
and i wish you away
without a sound
and i wish you away

without a sound without a sound
and i wish you away


late dawns and early sunsets just like my favorite scenes
then holding hands and life was perfect just like up on the screen
and the whole time while always giving
counting your face among the living

up and down escalators pennies and colder fountains
elevators and half price sales trapped in by all these mountains
running away and hiding with you
i never thought they'd get me here
not knowing you'd change from just one bite
i fought them all off just to hold you close and tight

but does anyone notice 
but does anyone care 
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
but would anything matter if you're already dead 
and well should i be shocked now by the last thing you said 
before i pull this trigger 
your eyes vacant and stained

but does anyone notice 
but does anyone care 
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
and would anything matter if you're already dead 
and now should i be shocked by the last thing you said 
before i pull this trigger 
your eyes vacant and stained
and in saying you loved me
made things harder at best
and these words changing nothing
as your body remains
and there's no room in this hell
there's no room in the next
and our memories defeat us
and i'll end this direst

but does anyone notice 
but does anyone care 
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
but does anything matter if you're already dead
and should i be shocked now by the last thing you said
before i pull this trigger
your eyes vacant and stained
and in saying you loved me
made things harder at best
and these words changing nothing
as your body remains
and there's no room in this hell 
there's no room in the next
but does anyone notice there's a corpse in this bed

every snowflake's different just like you
i'll sing about it if you ask me to
different shapes and different size like
every star up in the sky
every snowflake's different just like you

green fur
blue skin
and the very silly way you grin
big fangs
small chin
there's so many special things about you
things about you
things about you

every snowflake's different just like
every snowflake's different just like
every snowflake's different just like you
different shapes and different size like
every star up in the sky
every snowflake's different just like you

they wanna grip the cross
make cavities
and just because it purely is a crime
we full-on freak the cops that causality 
and break the walls of cryogenic slime

she said come on come on kiss my battery
come on come on i’ll be your android girl
she said come on come on kiss my battery
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world

turn up the fades and lies just dance with me
you stare me down and take my only guise
they need the ones you got
and laugh for me
destroy the council where your mother cries

she said come on come on kiss my battery
come on come on i’ll be your android girl
she said come on come on lick that battery
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world

we all gotta die
but tonight we’d sell our skins to get you out
we all gotta try
i’ll be red with another arms
with another slide
i don’t wanna know i don’t wanna go
i don’t gotta know where i’m gonna die
i don’t wanna know i don’t wanna go
i don’t gotta know where i’m gonna die

scratch them all
spit casually
a heart
you got it in the one you need
i’m at a loss because of tragedy
for what you got i got the ones you need
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come come on just spit causally
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world
she said come come on just spit causally
come on come on and fuck this whole wide world

some people watch some people pray
but even lights can fade away
some people hope some people pay
but why we have to stay

cause even heroes get the blues
or any misery you choose
you like to watch we like to use
and we were born to lose

i choose defeat i walk away
and leave this place the same today
some like to sleep we like to play
just look at all that pain

you want the heart or to be saved
but even good guys still get paid
so watch my back and keep the blade
i think it got you laid

so fake your death or it's your blame
and leave the lights on when you stay
take off your clothes and dream and fade
come on and feel that shame

i choose defeat i walk away
and leave this place the same today
some like to sleep we like to play
just look at all that pain

just look at all that pain

just look at all that pain
just look at all that pain
just give me all that pain
just give me all that pain
just give me all that pain

i choose defeat i walk away
and leave this place the same today
some like to sleep we like to play
just look at all that pain

now i know 
that i can't make you stay
but where's your heart
but where's your heart
but where's your

and i know
there's nothing i can say
to change that part
to change that part
to change

so many
bright lights they cast a shadow
but can i speak
well is it hard understanding
i'm incomplete
a life that's so demanding
i get so weak
a love that's so demanding
i can't speak

i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone 
honey if you stay i'll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home

can you see
my eyes are shining bright
'cause i'm out here
on the other side
of a jet black hotel mirror
and i'm so weak
is it hard understanding
i'm incomplete
a love that's so demanding
i get weak

i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone 
honey if you stay i'll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home

i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone 
honey if you stay i'll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home

these bright lights have always blinded me
these bright lights have always blinded me
i say

i see you lying next to me
with words i thought i'd never speak
awake and unafraid
asleep or dead

alright children 
the lights are out and the party's over
it's time for me: doctor d
to start running and say goodbye for a little while
and i know you're gonna miss me
so i'll leave you with this
you know that big ball of radiation we call the sun
well it'll burst you into flames
if you stay in one place too long
that is if the static don't get you first
so remember even if you're dusted
you may be gone
but out here in the desert
your shadow lives on without you
this is dr death defying 
signing off



(we could get somebody else but we want someone like you) 

well as soon as i get my gun
i’ll point it out the window at the setting sun
as soon as i get my gun
i’ll tell you all about it when you fall in love
as soon as i get my gun
i’m gonna make a call
well as soon as i get my gun
get my gun

well the uniform isn’t fun
they make it like we give ‘em out to anyone
as soon as we get your gun
a pocket full of pistol is a lot of fun
it’s just the kind of place we run
because the government
because the government wants your gun
wants your gun whoa

well if i’m old enough to die for your mistakes
then let’s go
can we bleed enough to fill up what the engine takes
we don’t know
but if you’re watching up above
they’re teaching me to kill
who’s teaching me to love
now baby

well as soon as i’ve got my gun (as soon as i’ve got my gun)
put me on vacation underneath the sun
as soon as i get my gun (as soon as i’ve got my gun)

out on the sand
we’re like a hold from a ied
‘cause i’m holding up my gun
holding up my gun

and if i’m old enough to die for your mistakes
then let’s go

wait until it fades to black
ride into the sunset
would i lie to you
well i've got something to say
grab your six-gun from your back
throttle the ignition
would i die for you
well here's your answer in spades

shotgun sinners
wild eyed jokers
got you in my sights
gun it while i'm holding on

after all is said and done
climb out from the pine box
well i'm asking you
'cause she's got nothing to say
the angels just cut out her tongue
call her black mariah
would i lie to you
that girl's not right in the brain

mass convulsions
strike the choir
by the grace of god
gun it while i'm holding on

but don't stop if i fall
and don't look back
oh baby don't stop 
bury me and fade to black

she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
so get your gun and meet me by the door 


she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
she won't stop me put it down
so baby

don't stop if i fall
and don't look back
oh baby don't stop
bury me and fade to black 


well don't stop

yeah

well let's go back to the middle of the day that starts it all
i can't begin to let you know just what i'm feeling
and now the red ones make me fly
and the blue ones help me fall
and i think i'll blow my brains against the ceiling
and as the fragments of my skull begin to fall
fall on your tongue like pixie dust just think happy thoughts


and we'll fly home
we'll fly home
you and i
we'll fly home

come on

well now i'm back in the middle of the day that starts it all
i can't begin to let you know just what i'm feeling
and now these red ones make me fly
and the blue ones help me fall
and i think i'll blow my brains against the ceiling


and we'll fly home
you and i
we'll fly home

now honestly that's what i said to her what i said to her

think happy thoughts 
think ha wooo

hear the sound 
the angels come screaming 
down your voice 
i hear you've been bleeding 

make your choice 
they say you've been pleading
someone save us 

heaven help us now 
come crashing down 
we'll hear the sound 
as you're falling down 

i'm at this old hotel
but can't tell if i've been breathing or sleeping 
or screaming or waiting for the man to call 
and maybe all of the above 
cause mostly i've been sprawled on these cathedral steps 
while spitting out the blood and screaming 


heaven help us now 
come crashing down 
we'll hear the sound 
as you're falling down 

and will you pray for me
or make a saint of me
and will you lay for me
or make a saint of

cause i'll give you all the nails you need 
cover me in gasoline 
wipe away those tears of blood again 
and the punchline to the joke is asking
someone save us 

heaven help us now 
come crashing down 
we'll hear the sound 
as you fall

and would you pray for me
(you don't know a thing about my sins
how the misery begins)
or make a saint of me
(you don't know
so i'm burning i'm burning)
and will you lay for me
(you don't know a thing about my sins
how the misery begins)
or make a saint
(you don't know
cause i'm burning i'm burning)

cause i'll give you all the nails you need 
(i'm burning i'm burning again)
cover me in gasoline again

long ago 
just like the hearse you die to get in again 
we are so far from you 

burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate 
the lives of everyone you know 
and what's the worst you take (worst you take)
from every heart you break (heart you break)
and like the blade you stain (blade you stain)
well i've been holding on tonight

what's the worst that i can say
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 

came a time 
when every star fall brought you to tears again 
we are the very hurt you sold 
and what's the worst you take (worst you take)
from every heart you break (heart you break)
and like the blade you stain (blade you stain)
well i've been holding on tonight 

what's the worst that i can say 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 
and if you carry on this way 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 

can you hear me 
are you near me 
can we pretend to leave and then
we'll meet again
when both our cars collide

what's the worst that i can say 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight 
and if you carry on this way 
things are better if i stay 
so long and goodnight 
so long and goodnight

for all the dirty looks the photographs your boyfriend took
remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor

i'm not okay
i'm not okay
i'm not okay
you wear me out

what will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems
(i'm not okay)
i've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(i'm not okay)
to be a joke and look another line without a hook
i held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look

i'm not okay
i'm not okay
i'm not okay
you wear me out

forget about the dirty looks
the photographs your boyfriend took
you said you read me like a book but the pages all are torn and frayed

i'm okay
i'm okay
i'm okay now
(i'm okay now)

but you really need to listen to me
because i'm telling you the truth
i mean this i'm okay
(trust me)

i'm not okay
i'm not okay
well i'm not okay
i'm not o-fucking-kay
i'm not okay

(okay)

saints protect her now 
come angels of the lord 
come angels of unknown

and what i'll do to you
you get what everyone else gets
you get a lifetime

let's go

do you remember that day when we met
you told me this gets harder
well it did
been holding on forever
promise me that when i'm gone you'll kill my enemies
the damage you've inflicted temporary wounds
i'm coming back from the dead and i'll take you home with me
i'm taking back the life you stole

we never got that far
this helps me to think all through the night
bright lights that won't kill me now or tell me how
just you and i your starless eyes remain

hip hip hooray for me you talk to me but would you kill me in my sleep
lay still like the dead
from the razor to the rosary
we could lose ourselves
and paint these walls in pitchfork red

i will avenge my ghost with every breath i take
i'm coming back from the dead and i'll take you home with me
i'm taking back the life you stole

this hole you put me in
wasn't deep enough
and i'm climbing out right now
you're running out of places to hide from me
when you go
just know that i will remember you
if living was the hardest part
we'll then one day be together
and in the end we'll fall apart
just like the leaves change in colors
and then i will be with you
i will be there one last time now

when you go
just know that i will remember you

i've lost my fear of falling
i will be with you
i will be with you

oh you look so tired 
your mouth is slack and wide 
you're ill-housed and you’re
you're ill-advised 
i bet your face is as mean
as your life has been 

and oh you look so tired 
well but tonight you presume too much
too much i said too much 
and if it's the last 
thing i ever do

you would cry out your eyes all along

we're damned after all
through fortune and flame we fall
and if you can stay then i'll show you the way
to return from the ashes you call

we all carry on (we all carry on)
when our brothers in arms are gone (when our brothers in arms are gone)
so raise your glass high
for tomorrow we die
and return from the ashes you call

salutations
from our greater northwest ally and
reservations
at the cosa nostra steak house 8 pm

you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
i’m turning into some dust
i’m turning into some bats

medication
and the way your eyes look into me
lubrication
can you turn off all the lights so i can’t see

you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
i’m dressing up like the crow
i’m turning into some rats

x-o x-o x-o x-o
x-o x-o x-o x-o

you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
he’s got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
they got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
i’m turning into some wolves
i’m dressing up like a cat
you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
you got your rickety bones i got my rickety hands
i’m so fucking old
i’m so fucking alone

gonna take off all my skin
tear apart all of my insides
when they rifle in
mom and dad think you'll be saved
they never had the time
they're gonna medicate your lives
you were always born a crime
we salute you in your grave

can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know
what i'd do just to get back in her arms
can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know
what i'd do just to get back in her arms


(well my gun fires
seven different shades of shit
so what's your favorite color punk)

do you wanna hold my hand
could you sign this photograph
'cause i'm your biggest fan
would you leave me lying here

we're not here to pay a compliment
or sing about the government
oxycontin genocide
adolescent suicide
i'll give you my sincerity 
{don't give} a fuck about a kennedy
here's what i've got to say

can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know
what i'd do just to get back in her arms
can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know 
what i'd do just to get back in her arms

no way home why 


we've got to go 


can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know 
what i'd do just to get back in her arms
can't find my way home
but it's through you and i know 
what i'd do just to get back well in her arms

i can't find the way 


come on angel don't you cry 


(na na na)

and i'll keep it in a bag in a box

burning your information

let's blow an artery
eat plastic surgery
keep your apology

and right here

all the way in battery city
the little children
raise their open filthy palms
like tiny daggers up to heaven
and all the juvee halls
and the ritalin rats
ask the angels made from neon 
and fucking garbage scream out 
and the sky opened up

everybody wants to change the world
everybody wants to change the world
but no one
no one wants to die
wanna try wanna try wanna try
wanna try wanna try now
i'll be your detonator

(na na na)

make no apology
it's death or victory
on my authority
crash and burn
young and loaded

drop like a bullet shell
dress like a sleeper cell
i'd rather go to hell
then be in purgatory
cut my hair
gag and bore me
pull this pin
let this world explode

be a man can a mystery man
or be a doll be a baby doll
it can't be fun not any way 
there can be found no way at all 
a distant man can't sympathise 
can't uphold his distant laws 
due to form on that today 
i got a feeling then i hear that call
i said 

neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon 
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat 

no crime if there ain't no law 
no more cops left to mess you around 
no more dreams of mystery chords 
no more sight to bring you down 

i got a crazy got a thought in my mind 
my mind's on when she falls asleep 
feelin' fine in her restless time 
then these words upon me creep i said

neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon 
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat she can't afford a cannon
neat neat neat she can't afford a gun at all 
neat neat neat

and die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
and we can settle this affair
if you would shed your yellow take my hand
and then we'll solve the mystery of laceration gravity
this riddle of revenge please understand it has to be this way

stand up fucking tall
don't let them see your back
and take my fucking hand
and never be afraid again

welcome to this institution 
one way to resolution 
i'm put on this medication 
rolls down my throat 

cause i can't ever sleep at night the same 
this medication enjoys enjoys most every day 

cause i close my eyes 
i see land 

what did i say 
what did i say to put sister to sleep 
and fall awake and die 
and i'm never goin' to bed 

back to the day back into this day 
back to another level hotter then hell
said that we're not savages until we do it 
again 
and one last night i'll kiss your lips again 

what did i say 
what did i say to put sister to sleep
and fall awake and die 
and i'm never goin' to sleep 

i will take this ferris wheel
and i'm sleepwalking back into this hell 

oh my darling 
for the first time 

don't let me sleep tonight 
and get in your way tonight 
don't let me sleep tonight 
get in your way 

what did i say 
what did i say to put sister to sleep 
i'll never go to sleep 
and i won't go back to bed 

i'm sleepwalking back into this 
hell
oh god

you're not in this alone
let me break this awkward silence
let me go go on record
be the first to say i'm sorry
hear me out 
and if you take me down
or would you lay me out
and if the world needs something better
let's give them one more reason now now now

we walk in single file
we light our rails and punch our time
ride escalators colder than a cell


this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes
hello angel tell me where are you
tell me where we go from here


tell me we go from

and in this moment we can't close the lids on burning eyes
our memories blanket us with friends we know like fallout vapors
steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun scorched and black
it reaches in and tears your flesh apart
as ice cold hands rip into your heart

that's if you've still got one that's left inside that cave you call a chest
and after seeing what we saw can we still reclaim our innocence
and if the world needs something better let's give them one more reason now


this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes
hello angel tell me where are you
tell me where we go from here


tell me we go from here

there are these terrors and it's like it feels like as if somebody was gripping my
there are these terrors and it's like it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
like last night they are not like tremors they are worse than tremors there are these terrors
like last night they are not like tremors they are worse than tremors there are these terrors
and it's like it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat and squeezing and
it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat

some say now suffer all the children
and walk away a savior
or a madman and polluted
from gutter institutions
don't you breathe for me
undeserving of your sympathy
cause there ain't no way that i'm sorry for what i did

and through it all
how could you cry for me
cause i don't feel bad about it
so shut your eyes
kiss me goodbye
and sleep
just sleep

the hardest part is letting go of your dreams

a drink for the horror that i'm in
for the good guys and the bad guys
for the monsters that i've been
three cheers for tyranny
unapologetic apathy
cause there ain't no way that i'm coming back again

and through it all
how could you cry for me
cause i don't feel bad about it
so shut your eyes
kiss me goodbye
and sleep
just sleep

the hardest part's the awful things that i've seen

sometimes i see flames 
and sometimes i see people that i love dying and it's always

just sleep
just sleep
just sleep
just sleep
just sleep
just sleep

wake up
wake up
wake up
wake up
wake up



woo hoo
woo hoo
woo hoo
woo hoo

i got my head checked
by a jumbo jet
it wasn't easy
but nothing is
woo hoo
when i feel heavy metal
woo hoo
and i'm pins and i'm needles
woo hoo
well i lie and i'm easy
all of the time but i'm never sure why i need you
pleased to meet you

i got my head done
when i was young
it's not my problem
it's not my problem

woo hoo
when i feel heavy metal
woo hoo
and i'm pins and i'm needles
woo hoo
well i lie and i'm easy
all of the time but i'm never sure why i need you
pleased to meet you

yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah

go

say the lights are really low enough to play
can you catch me when i'm falling down
and all alone a moment if
you try to make the most of this
couldn't you always love me
then you made me walk away

and would you stay right here
when i tell you
that someone out there loves you
if you stay right here
when i'd tell you
that someone out there loves you after all

sometimes these things can always be so small
sometimes you could hit right back
hold me down to catch this vision
watch me make that most of this
could you make me kiss you
when we decimate the stars

and would you stay right here
when i tell you
that someone out there loves you
stay right here
when i'm telling you
that someone out there loves you

if there is no one no one out there
is there no one no one who cares
if there is no one no one out there
is there no one like you to share
would you ask yourself
would you ask yourself

stay
and would you stay right here
when i tell you
that someone out there loves you
if you stay right here stay right here
stay with me stay right here stay right here
stay with me stay with me stay with me
stay with me stay with me stay with me
stay with me stay with me stay with me
stay with me stay with me
stay stay stay
stay

when the lights go out
will you take me with you
and carry all this broken bone
through six years down in crowded rooms
and highways i call home
is something i can’t know till now
till you picked me off the ground
with brick in hand your lip gloss smile
your scraped up knees

and if you stay 
i would even wait all night
or until my heart explodes
how long
until we find our way
in the dark and out of harm
you can run away with me
anytime you want

terrified of what i’d be
as a kid from what i’ve seen
every single day when people try
and put the pieces back together
just to smash them down
turn my headphones up real loud
i don't think i need them now
‘cause you stop the noise

and if you stay 
i would even wait all night
or until my heart explodes
how long
until we find our way
in the dark and out of harm
you can run away with me
anytime you want

anytime you want
anytime you want

don’t walk away 

'cause if you stay
i would even wait all night
well or until my heart explodes
how long
until we find out way
in the dark and out of harm
you can run away with me
you can write it on your arm
you can run away with me
anytime you want

everyone’s a passenger tonight
just another accidental on the freeway of this life
we'll drive on and on and on and on
we'll drive on and on and
i'll remember this night when you’re gone

you surrender your heart
i surrender every dream
every weapon you've got
every secret that i keep
you can fight this all you want
but tonight belongs to

just another surgery tonight
well if you amputate the loneliness
'til anesthesia dims the lights
so dream on and on and on and on
so dream on and on and
i'll remember your eyes when you’re gone

you surrender your heart
i surrender every dream
every weapon you've got
every secret that i keep
you can fight this all you want
but tonight belongs to me

and i'll watch you in your sleep
'cause tonight belongs to me
you can fight this all you want
but tonight belongs to

sparks against the railing
distant phantoms wailing
through the windshield sailing
with these airbags failing now

you surrender your heart
i surrender every dream
every weapon you've got
every secret that i keep
you can fight this all you want
but tonight belongs to me

and i'll watch you in your sleep
you can fight this all you want
but tonight belongs to me
but tonight belongs to me
but tonight belongs to me

they're gonna clean up your looks
with all the lies in the books
to make a citizen out of you
because they sleep with a gun
and keep an eye on you son
so they can watch all the things you do

because the drugs never work
they're gonna give you a smirk
'cause they got methods of keeping you clean
they're gonna rip up your heads
your aspirations to shreds
another cog in the murder machine

they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone but not me

the boys and girls in the clique
the awful names that they stick
you're never gonna fit in much kid
but if you're troubled and hurt
what you got under your shirt
will make them pay for the things that they did

they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone but not me

ohhh yeah

they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone but not me

you can find out firsthand what it's like to be me
so gather 'round piggies and kiss this goodbye
i'd encourage your smiles i'll expect you won't cry

(save me) get me the hell out of here
(save me) too young to die and my dear

i can't always just forget her
but she could try

at the end of the world
or the last thing i see

never coming home

and all the things that you never ever told me

gaze into her killing jar 
i'd sometimes stare for hours (sometimes stare for hours)
she even poked the holes so i can breathe
she bought the last line
i'm just the worst kind
of guy to argue
with what you might find
and for the last night i lie
could i lie with you

alright give up get down
it's just the hardest part of living
alright she wants
it all to come down this time

lost in the prescription 
she's got something else in mind (something else in mind)
check into the hotel bella muerte
it gives the weak flight
it gives the blind sight
until the cops come
or by the last light
and for the last night i lie
could i lie next to you

alright give up get down
it's just the hardest part of living
alright she wants
it all to come down this time

alright give up get down
it's just the hardest part of living
alright she wants
it all to come down this time

pull the plug
but i'd like to learn your name
and holding on
well i hope you do the same
aw sugar
slip into the tragedy you've spun this chamber dry

alright give up get down
it's just the hardest part of living
alright she wants
it all to come down this time

alright give up get down
it's just the hardest part of living
alright she wants
it all to come down this time

pull the plug
but i'd like to learn your name
and holding on
well i hope you do the same
aw sugar

well now this could be the last of all the rides we take
so hold on tight and don't look back
we don't care about the message 
or the rules they make
i'll find you when the sun goes black

and you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that 
now we are the kids from yesterday

all the cameras watch the accidents and stars you hate
they only care if you can bleed
does the television make you feel the pills you ate
or every person that you need to be

'cause you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that 
now we are the kids from yesterday

today today
we are the kids from yesterday
today today

here we are and we don't stop breathing
yell it out 'til your heart stops beating
we are the kids from yesterday
today

'cause you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that 
now we are the kids from yesterday
we are the kids from yesterday
we are the kids from yesterday
we are the kids from yesterday
today today

so long to all of my friends 
everyone of them met tragic ends 
with every passing day
i’d be lying if i didn’t say 
that i miss them all tonight

and if they only knew 
what i would say 
if i could be with you tonight
i would sing you to sleep 
never let them take the light behind your eyes
one day i’ll lose this fight
as we fade in the dark
just remember you will always burn as bright

be strong and hold my hand
time becomes for us you’ll understand 
we’ll say goodbye today 
and we’re sorry how it ends this way
if you promise not to cry 
then i'll tell you just what i would say 

if i could be with you tonight 
i would sing you to sleep 
never let them take the light behind your eyes 
i’ll fail and lose this fight 
never fade in the dark  
just remember that you will always burn as bright

the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your 

sometimes we must grow stronger 
and you can’t be stronger in the dark 
when i’m here no longer 
you must be stronger and 

if i could be with you tonight 
i would sing you to sleep 
never let them take the light behind your eyes 
i failed and lost this fight 
never fade in the dark 
just remember you will always burn as bright 

the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…

the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…
the light behind your eyes…

remember me 

where where will you stand
when all the lights go out
across these city streets
where were you when
all of the embers fell
i still remember there
covered in ash
covered in glass
covered and all my friends 
i still think of the bombs they built

if there's a place that i could be
then i'd be another memory
can i be the only hope for you
because you're the only hope for me
and if we can't find where we belong
we'll have to make it on our own
face all the pain and take it on
because the only hope for me 
is you alone

how it should be
many years after the disasters that we've seen
what have we learned
other than people burn in purifying flame
i say it's okay
i know you can tell
and though you can see me smile
i still think of the guns they sell

if there's a place that i could be
then i'd be another memory
can i be the only hope for you
because you're the only hope for me
and if we can't find where we belong
we'll have to make it on our own
face all the pain and take it on
because the only hope for me 
is you alone

the only hope for me
the only hope for me
is you the only hope for me 
is you the only hope

if there's a place that i could be
then i'd be another memory
can i be the only hope for you
because you're the only hope for me
and if we can't find where we belong
we'll have to make it on our own
face all the pain and take it on
because the only hope for me is you alone
the only hope for me is you alone

the only hope for me is you  (remember me remember me)

well it rains and it pours
when you're out on your own
if i crash on the couch
can i sleep in my clothes
'cause i've spent the night dancing
i'm drunk i suppose
if it looks like i'm laughing
i'm really just asking to leave

this alone you're in time for the show
you're the one that i need
i'm the one that you loathe
you can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
'cause i love all the poison
away with the boys in the band

i've really been on a bender and it shows
so why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes

give me a shot to remember
and you can take all the pain away from me
a kiss and i will surrender
the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
a light to burn all the empires
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
in love with all of these vampires
so you can leave like the sane abandoned me

there's a place in the dark where the animals go
you can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands romeo

i've really been on a bender and it shows
so why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes

give me a shot to remember
and you can take all the pain away from me
a kiss and i will surrender
the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
a light to burn all the empires
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
in love with all of these vampires
so you can leave like the sane abandoned me


these are the eyes and the lies of the taken
these are their hearts but their hearts don’t beat like ours
they burn ‘cause they are all afraid
for every one of us there’s an army of them
but you’ll never fight alone
‘cause i wanted you to know

that the world is ugly
but you’re beautiful to me
well are you thinking of me now (now)

these are the nights and the lights that we fade in
these are the words but the words aren’t coming out
they burn ‘cause they are hard to say
for every failing sun there’s a morning after
though i’m empty when you go
i just wanted you to know

that the world is ugly
but you’re beautiful to me
are you thinking of me
like i’m thinking of you
i would say i’m sorry though
though i really need to go
i just wanted you to know

i wanted you to know
i wanted you to know
i’m thinking of you every night every day

these are the eyes and the lies of the taken
these are their hearts but their hearts don’t beat like ours
they burn ‘cause they are all afraid
when mine beats twice as hard

‘cause the world is ugly
but you’re beautiful to me
are you thinking of me
like i’m thinking of you
i would say i’m sorry though
though i really need to go
i just wanted you to know
that the world is ugly (i just wanted you to know)
but you’re beautiful to me (i just wanted you to know)
are you thinking of me

stop your crying helpless feeling
dry your eyes and start believing
there’s one thing they’ll never take from you

(and we’ll never be the same
like ghosts in the snow
like ghosts in the sun)

the world is ugly
but you're beautiful to me
are you thinking of me
like i'm thinking of you

i would say i'm sorry
but i really need to go

i just wanted you to know
that the world is ugly
but you're beautiful to me

are you thinking of me
are you thinking of him

you could say you're sorry
but i think you both should go
i just wanted you to know

there's an ache in my heart
and there's a burning in my eyes
i could get a new start
but i'd rather learn not try
i could find a new place
maybe no one knows my name
but i think it's just a phase
oh are you happy now
now that you got
what you came for
are you
are you happy now
now that you got
what you came for
are you happy now
now that you got what you came for
are you happy
now
are you happy now
now that you got what you came for

go

to un-explain the unforgivable
drain all the blood and give the kids a show
by streetlight this dark night
a séance down below
there're things that i have done 
you never should ever know

and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now
and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now

who walks among the famous living dead
drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
and if you could talk to me
tell me if it's so
that all the good girls go to heaven
well heaven knows

that without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now
and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now

can you hear me cry out to you
words i thought i'd choke on figure out
i'm really not so with you anymore
i'm just a ghost 
so i can't hurt you anymore
so i can't hurt you anymore

and now you wanna see how far down i can sink
let me go fuck
so you can well now so you can
i'm so far away from you
well now so you can

and without you is how i disappear
and without you is how i disappear
whoa whoa (and without you is how i disappear)
whoa whoa (and without you is how is how is how)
forever forever now

and we can run from the backdrop of these gears and scalpels
at every hour goes the tick-tock bang of monitors as
they stared us down when we met in the emergency room
and in our beds i could hear you breathe with help from cold machines

every hour on the hour they drew blood

well i felt i couldn't take another day inside this place
from silent dreams we never wake and in this promise that we'll make
starless eyes for heaven's sake but i hear you anyway
well i thought i heard you
say i like you we can get out
we don't have to stay stay inside this place

someday this day we kept falling down
someday this day set the ferris wheel ablaze
you left my heart an open wound
and i love you for
this day someday we kept falling down
one day this day all we had to keep us safe
and if we never sleep again it would never end
well i thought i heard you say to me
we'll go so far far as we can
and i just can't stay one day we'll run away

he calls the mansion not a house but a tomb
he's always choking from the stench and the fume
the wedding party all collapsed in the room
so send my resignation to the bride and the groom
let's go down
this elevator only goes up to ten
he's not around
he's always looking at men
down by the pool
he doesn't have many friends
as they are
face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens

if you marry me
would you bury me
would you carry me to the end

(so say goodbye) to the vows you take
(and say goodbye) to the life you make
(and say goodbye) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

she keeps a picture of the body she lends
got nasty blisters from the money she spends
she's got a life of her own and it shows by the benz
she drives at 90 by the barbies and kens
if you ever say never too late 
i'll forget all the diamonds you ate
lost in coma and covered in cake
increase the medication
share the vows at the wake
(kiss the bride)

if you marry me
would you bury me
would you carry me to the end

(so say goodbye) to the vows you take
(and say goodbye) to the life you make
(and say goodbye) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

(and say goodbye) to the last parade
(and walk away) from the choice you made 
(and say goodnight) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

(so say goodbye) to the vows you take
(and say goodbye) to the life you make
(and say goodbye) to the heart you break
and all the cyanide you drank

(and say goodbye) to the last parade
(and walk away) from the choice you made
(and say goodnight) to the heart you break 
and all the cyanide you drank

to the last parade
when the parties fade
and the choice you made
to the end

fell in love with a vampire
you want to get it for free
say hello to the brush fire
you want to take it from me
i'm gonna take it from you

say hello to the good times
burning up in the sun
you're sitting back on an empire
while the world lays back
puts a kid behind that gun

if we crash this time
they got machines to keep us alive
when the mixtape lies
choke down the words with no meaning
i stopped bleeding 3 years ago
while you keep screaming for revolution
me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
we got no heroes cuz our heroes are dead

say hello to the program
they're gonna give it for free
hook up the vein to the antibodies
and cut it with the disease
i'm gonna give it to you

put on your smile for the good times
you're loaded up with the fame
you're dressing up like a virus
but the words get lost when we all look the same

if we crash this time
they got machines to keep us alive
when the mixtape lies
choke down the words with no meaning
i stopped bleeding 3 years ago
while you keep screaming for revolution
me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
we got no heroes cuz our heroes are dead

you fell in love with a vampire
a torch-song for the empire
so say hello to the brush-fire
the microphones got a tap-wire

if we crash this time
they got machines to keep us alive
while the army wives
choke down a war with no meaning
i stopped bleeding 3 years ago
while you keep screaming for revolution
because rebellions not a t-shirt you sell
you keep your money and i'll see you in hell

pressure

pushing down on me
pressing down on you no man ask for
under pressure
that burns a building down
splits a family in two
puts people on streets

bah bah dah bah bah dah
(yeah) (yeah)

that's okay
it's the terror of knowing
what this world is about
watching some good friends
scream 
pray tomorrow takes me higher
pressure on people
people on streets

bah bah dah bah bah dah
okay

chippin' around
kick my brains round the floor
these are the days
it never rains but it pours
bah bah dah bah bah dah

people on streets
bah dah dee da day
people on streets
bah dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah

it's the terror of knowing
what this world is about
watching some good friends
scream 
pray tomorrow takes me higher (higher)

yeah

turned away from it all
like a blind man
sat on a fence but it don't work
keep coming up with love
but it's so slashed and torn

why why why
love(love) love(love) love(love)

insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
can't we give ourselves one more chance
why can't we give love that one more chance
why can't we give love give love give love
give love give love give love give love give love

cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care
for the people on the edge of the night
and love dares you to change our ways
of caring about ourselves

this is our last dance
this is our last dance
this is ourselves under pressure

under pressure
under pressure

i sure like the way you look in that
i sure like the way you look in that
there there there
oh i'm such an idiot
our music is way too loud
here let me turn it down a little bit
sorry)

and if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground
and if they get me take this spike to my heart and
and if they get me and the sun goes down
and if they get me take this spike and
you put the spike in my heart

and if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones
and then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks i saw you there
someone get me to the doctor someone get me to a church
where they can pump this venom gaping hole
and you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
and if they come and get me
what if you put the spike in my heart

and if they get me and the sun goes down
and if they get me take this spike and

(come on)


can you take this spike
will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
night time sky
can you take this spike
will it wash away this jet black feeling

and now the nightclub sets the stage for this they come in pairs she said
we'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there
someone get me to the doctor and someone call the nurse
and someone buy me roses and someone burned the church
we're hanging out with corpses and driving in this hearse
and someone save my soul tonight please save my soul


can you take this spike
will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
night time sky
can you take this spike
will it wash away this jet black now

(let's go come on)

and as these days watch over time and as these days watch over time
and as these days watch over us tonight


i'll never let them i'll never let them
i'll never let them hurt you not tonight
i'll never let them i can't forget them
i'll never let them hurt you i promise

struck down before our prime
before you got off the floor
can you stake my heart can you stake my heart

can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
(and these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light 
and this venom from my heart)

can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
(and these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light 
kill this venom from my heart)

can you stake me before the sun goes down

(and as always innocent like roller coasters
fatality is like ghosts in snow and you have no idea what you're up against 
because i've seen what they look like 
becoming perfect as if they were sterling silver chainsaws going cascading)

give up and give it a shot
dedication to the places that you never need to hide
occupations the opportunity to see yourself in lights

and all the city fires and the tabloid lies
and the television guides
for the missions and the boulevards
and the way it is when money’s all you got
 
stop and stare
at the accidents and stars that bore you
we don’t dare singing another song for california
anywhere
where the city lights are hopeless for you
we don’t care i needed another song for california
 
shut up and give me a shot
on vacation to the places that you never want to die
on the station everybody hears but no one needs to try

on the telephone on the methadone
every minute that you scrape
for the errant scars and the dying stars
every second that you take to fake your life
 
stop and stare
at the accidents and stars that bore you
we don’t dare singing another song for california
anywhere
where the city lights are hopeless for you
we don’t care i needed another song for california
 
stop and stare
at the accidents and stars that bore you
we don’t dare singing another song for california
anywhere
where the city lights are hopeless for you
we don’t care i needed another song for california

when i was a young boy
my father took me into the city
to see a marching band

he said son when you grow up
would you be the saviour of the broken 
the beaten and the damned
he said will you defeat them
your demons and all the non-believers 
the plans that they have made
because one day i'll leave you
a phantom to lead you in the summer
to join the black parade

when i was a young boy
my father took me into the city
to see a marching band
he said son when you grow up
would you be the saviour of the broken 
the beaten and the damned

sometimes i get the feeling she's watching over me
and other times i feel like i should go
and through it all the rise and fall the bodies in the streets
and when you're gone we want you all to know

we'll carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on
we'll carry on
and in my heart i can't contain it
the anthem won't explain it

a world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
your misery and hate will kill us all
so paint it black and take it back
let's shout it loud and clear
defiant to the end we hear the call

to carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches

on and on we carry through the fears
ooh oh ohhhh
disappointed faces of your peers
ooh oh ohhhh
take a look at me cause i could not care at all

do or die you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try you'll never break me
we want it all we wanna play this part
i won't explain or say i'm sorry
i'm unashamed i'm gonna show my scar
give a cheer for all the broken
listen here because it's who we are
i'm just a man i'm not a hero
just a boy who had to sing this song
i'm just a man i'm not a hero
i don't care

we'll carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches on

do or die you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try you'll never break me
we want it all we wanna play this part (we'll carry on)

do or die you'll never make me (we'll carry on)
because the world will never take my heart (we'll carry on)
go and try you'll never break me (we'll carry)
we want it all we wanna play this part (we'll carry on)

in the middle of a gun fight 
in the center of a restaurant 
they say  
well they're never gonna get me 
like a bullet through a flock of doves 
to wage this war against your faith in me 
your lifewill never be the same 
on your mother's eyes say a prayersay a prayer 


now but i can't 
and i don't know 
how we're just two men as god had made us 
well i can'twell i can 
too much too late or just not enough of this 
pain in my heart for your dying wish 
i'll kiss your lips again 

they all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost 
my cellmate's a killer they make me do push-ups (in drag) 
but nobody cares if you're losing yourselfam i losing myself 
well i miss my mom 
will they give me the chair 
or lethal injection or swing from a rope if you dare; 
ah nobody knowsall the trouble i've seen 



to your room 
what they ask of you 
will make you want to say  
well i don't remember 
why rememberyou 

do you have the keys to the hotel 
'cause i'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire (fire)
 
life is but a dream for the dead 
and well i i won't go down by myself 
but i'll go down with my friends 
now now now now (i can't explain)
now now now (i can't complain)
now now yeah

i don't like being alone
burn up these streets
turn up the stereo
synthetic animals like me never have a home
i'm not the one you will be walking through
and if you kill him for me
well then i'll kill him for you

i'll meet you down at the metro station
hah cause motherfucker's got my motivation
now i'm gonna show you how much i love you
oh my magazine is full of ugly things

don't need this system
we can kill them if we try
shoot up everything we see
and we'll find it on the wall
i hope you die

manipulation just to form an alibi
you're the prototype for me
and if heaven wants to take us they can try

oh ah

sometimes i sleep
i like to talk about television
oh i'm not so glad right now
heartbreak heartbeats
got the eyes on you
and give them something to say
'cause i got something to prove

i don't have much of an education
but i got a knack for elimination
now turn up the dial
hit the tyres that screech

let's go
right here
right now
this is the bonus stage

don't need this system
we can kill them if we try
shoot up everything we see
and we'll find it on the wall
i hope you die

manipulation
just to form an alibi
you're the prototype for me
and if heaven wants to take us they can try

i want annihilation
a new design for x and y
i want your violation
deflect the system with our mind
exterminate the dream
extermination you can buy

don't need this system
we can kill them if we try
shoot up everything we see
and we'll find it on the wall
i hope you die

manipulation just to form an alibi
you're the prototype for me
and if heaven wants to take us they can

i hate you
kill everybody

i hate you
kill everybody

i try to love that way
of getting information
i've gotta walk away
shout like a suffocation

call me zero zero zero
call me zero you are zero
call me zero zero zero
call me zero you are zero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

another cloudy day
another observation
you've got to walk away
down by the record station

call me zero zero zero
call me zero you are zero
call me zero zero zero
call me zero you are zero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

you're comin' around and give me lots of station
oh oh oh and you'll be comin' around until you go and make up
give me some sort of disease oh give me teenage razors
give me some sort of disease oh give me higher fazers

you've gotta love that way
give me some information
she's gotta walk away

call me zero zero zero
call me zero you are zero
call me zero zero zero
call me zero you are zero
call me zero zero zero
call me zero i am zero
call me zero zero zero
call me zero zero zero
